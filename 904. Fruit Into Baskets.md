# 904. Fruit Into Baskets 

id:: 904
name:: Fruit Into Baskets
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Sliding Windows

## Description
You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

-   You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
-   Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
-   Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

## Examples

**Input:** fruits = `[1,2,1`]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can pick from all 3 trees.

**Input:** fruits = `[0,1,2,2`]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can pick from trees `[1,2,2`].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees `[0,1`].

**Input:** fruits = `[1,2,3,2,2`]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** We can pick from trees `[2,3,2,2`].

If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees `[1,2`].

## Algorithm
1. We iterate on the array maintaining:
	1. `result`: The largest number of fruits carried so far.
	2. `current`: The current number of fruits carried.
	3. `bType`: The type of the fruit seen most recently.
	4. `aType`: The other type of fruit.
	5. `bCount`: The size of the current "streak" of `bType` fruits.
 2. Maintaining `bCount` allows us "drop" all the `aType` fruits from `current` and move our window up to the start of the most recent `bType` "streak".
 3. Note that we do not actually maintain the start and end of our window but simply manipulate the counts.

## Code
```cpp
auto totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) -> int {
	auto result = 0, current = 0, 
		aType = -1, bType = -1,
		bCount = 0;

	for (const auto& cType : fruits) {
		if (cType == aType) {
			++current;
			aType = bType, bType = cType;
			bCount = 1;
		} else if (cType == bType) {
			++current;
			++bCount;
		} else {
			current = bCount + 1;
			aType = bType, bType = cType;
			bCount = 1;
		}

		result = max(result, current);
	}

	return result;
}
```
