# 1626. Best Team With No Conflicts 

id:: 1626
name:: Best Team With No Conflicts
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Dynamic Programming, Sorting

## Description
You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly higher score than an older player. A conflict does not occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the `ith` player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.

## Examples
**Input:** scores = `[1,3,5,10,15]`, ages = `[1,2,3,4,5]`
**Output:** 34
**Explanation:** You can choose all the players.

**Input:** scores = `[4,5,6,5]`, ages = `[2,1,2,1]`
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple people of the same age.

**Input:** scores = `[1,2,3,5]`, ages = `[8,9,10,1]`
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** It is best to choose the first 3 players.

## Algorithm
1. First we create a vector containing both the pieces of information and sort it in reverse order with respect to the player's ages. 
2. This allows us to traverse the vector knowing that all the previously processed players are older than the current player.
3. We maintain a vector containing the best score of a team formed by that player and a selection of the players up to that point.
4. For every player we initialise the best score with the score of the current player. This represents a team consisting only of the current player.
5. Then we check the best scores of all the previous players. If we do not cause conflict with this player. that is, we have a score lesser than that player, we can include the current player in that previous player's best score team.
6. Note that a previous player's best score team can only have older players with score greater than him. This allows us to safely include the current player without having to check for conflicts with the entire best score team for that previous player.
7. To get the overall best score, we just choose the maximum score in the list of best scores.

## Code
```cpp
auto bestTeamScore(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& ages) -> int {
	vector<pair<int, int>> players;
	transform(scores.cbegin(), scores.cend(), ages.cbegin(), back_inserter(players), 
		[](const int s, const int a) -> pair<int, int> { return { a, s }; });
	sort(players.begin(), players.end(), greater<>());

	vector<int> best_score(players.size());
	for (size_t i = 0; i < players.size(); ++i) {
		best_score[i] = players[i].second;

		for (size_t j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
			if (players[i].second > players[j].second) continue;
			
			best_score[i] = max(best_score[i], best_score[j] + players[i].second);
		}
	}

	return *max_element(best_score.begin(), best_score.end());
}
```
