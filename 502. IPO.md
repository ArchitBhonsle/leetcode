# 502. IPO 

id:: 502
name:: IPO
difficulty:: Hard (Medium)
category:: Greedy, Priority Queues

## Description
Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximise your final capital**, and return _the final maximised capital_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

## Examples
**Input:** k = 2, w = 0, profits = `[1,2,3]`, capital = `[0,1,1]`
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximised capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

**Input:** k = 3, w = 0, profits = `[1,2,3]`, capital = `[0,1,2]`
**Output:** 6

## Algorithm
This problem be solved simply using the [[notes/programming/algorithms/Greedy Approach|Greedy Approach]]. Since we can only increase our capital, we can get to the optimal outcome if we just keep consuming the project with the highest profit which we can currently undertake.

1. Pair up a project's initial capital and the final profit. Then we sort these projects by their initial capital.
2. Now we loop `k` times and in each iteration we add all the feasible project's profit to a [[notes/Priority Queue|priority queue]] so we can pick a course with the highest profit.

## Code
```cpp
auto findMaximizedCapital(
	int nProjects, int currentCapital, vector<int>& profits, vector<int>& capital
) -> int {
	vector<pair<int, int>> projects;
	transform(
		capital.begin(), capital.end(), profits.begin(), back_inserter(projects),
		[](const int p, const int c) { return make_pair(p, c); }
	);
	sort(projects.begin(), projects.end());

	priority_queue<int> heap;
	auto nextProject = projects.begin();
	while (nProjects--) {
		while (nextProject != projects.end() && nextProject->first <= currentCapital) {
			heap.push(nextProject->second);
			++nextProject;
		}

		if (!heap.empty()) {
			currentCapital += heap.top(); heap.pop();
		}
	}

	return currentCapital;
}
```
