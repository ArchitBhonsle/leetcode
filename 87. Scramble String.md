# 87. Scramble String 

id:: 87
name:: Scramble String
difficulty:: Hard (Medium-Hard)
category:: Recursion, Strings, Dynamic Programming

## Description
We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:
1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    -   Split the string into two non-empty sub-strings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    -   **Randomly**Â decide to swap the two sub-strings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    -   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two sub-strings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
"great" --> "gr/eat" , divide at random index.
"gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" , random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
"gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" , apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
"g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" , random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
"r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" , again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at" to "a/t".
"r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" , random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

### Example 2
**Input:** s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
**Output:** false

### Example 3
**Input:** s1 = "a", s2 = "a"
**Output:** true

## Constraints
-   `s1.length == s2.length`
-   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
-   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Algorithm
1. First, we implement the function to check if two strings are scrambled recursively. 
2. Check if the two strings are equal. If they are then return `true`.
3. Check if the two strings consist of the same characters. If not, return `false`.
4. Now, for every point where we can split the strings, we check if all the any combination of the two parts from both the words recursively are scrambled. If yes, then return `true`.
5. Then at the end return `false` for the word pairs that do not meet the above criteria.
6. Although the solution is correct so far, it is not fast enough. So we maintain a `cache` where we store the results of all the previously checked word pairs. Then before running the recursive function, check if we have already performed the computation and return the cached result.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n^2)$ as every possible pair of strings is processed only once.
- Space: $O(n^{2})$ as the result of every possible pair of strings can be stored in cache. And the same number of entries can occur in on the recursion stack.

## Code
```cpp
auto isScramble(string word1, string word2) -> bool {
	map<pair<string_view, string_view>, bool> cache;

	auto recurse = [&cache](auto&& recurse, string_view word1, string_view word2) {
		if (auto it = cache.find({ word1, word2 }); it != cache.end())
			return it->second;

		if (word1 == word2) return true;
		
		auto n = word1.size();

		array<int, 26> count;
		count.fill(0);
		for (const auto& char1 : word1) ++count[char1 - 'a'];
		for (const auto& char2 : word2) --count[char2 - 'a'];

		if (any_of(count.begin(), count.end(), [](const int c) { return c != 0; }))
			return false;
		
		for (auto i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
			if((
				recurse(recurse, word1.substr(0, i), word2.substr(0, i)) 
				&& recurse(recurse, word1.substr(i), word2.substr(i))
			) || (
				recurse(recurse, word1.substr(0, i), word2.substr(n - i))
				&& recurse(recurse, word1.substr(i), word2.substr(0, n - i))
			)) return cache[{ word1, word2 }] = true;
		}

		return cache[{ word1, word2 }] = false;
	};

	return recurse(recurse, word1, word2);
}
```
