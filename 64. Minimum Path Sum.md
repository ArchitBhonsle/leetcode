# 64. Minimum Path Sum 

id:: 64
name:: Minimum Path Sum
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Dynamic Programming

## Description
Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimises the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/minpath.jpg)
**Input:** grid = `[[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]`
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimises the sum.

### Example 2
**Input:** grid = `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`
**Output:** 12

## Constraints
-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
-   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

## Algorithm
This is one the most straightforward [[notes/Dynamic Programming|dynamic programming]] problems.
1. `dp` will store the minimum path sum required to reach the corresponding cell in the `grid`.
2. We iterate over all the cells from left to right and top to bottom. This order makes sure that the cells a given cell is dependent on are processed first.
3. We can arrive at a given cell either from the cell above it or the cell to its left. If that cell is not present we assume the value to be infinity.
4. Then the updated value for a given cell in the `dp` matrix would be the minimum of these two.
5. The first cell, is an exception and it's `dp` value is equal to it's `grid` value.
6. In the end, we simply return the `dp` value of the last cell.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(nm)$ as we iterate over all the elements in the `grid`.
- Space: $O(nm)$ as `dp` takes just as much space as `grid`.

## Code
```cpp
auto minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) -> int {
	auto nrows = grid.size(), ncols = grid[0].size();
	vector<vector<int>> dp(nrows, vector<int>(ncols));

	for (auto i = 0; i < nrows; ++i) {
		for (auto j = 0; j < ncols; ++j) {
			if (i == 0 && j == 0) {
				dp[i][j] = grid[i][j];
				continue;
			}

			auto top = i == 0 ? INT_MAX : dp[i - 1][j] + grid[i][j],
				left = j == 0 ? INT_MAX : dp[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j];
			dp[i][j] = min(top, left);
		}
	}

	return dp[nrows - 1][ncols - 1];
}
```
