# 2492. Minimum Score of Path Between Two Cities 

id:: 2492
name:: Minimum Score of Path Between Two Cities
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Graph Traversal

## Description
You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The **score** of a path between two cities is defined as the **minimum** distance of a road in this path.

Return _the **minimum** possible score of a path between cities_ `1` _and_ `n`.

**Note**:
-   A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
-   It is allowed for a path to contain the same road **multiple** times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
-   The test cases are generated such that there is **at least** one path between `1` and `n`.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph11.png)
**Input:** n = 4, roads = `[[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]`
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph22.png)
**Input:** n = 4, roads = `[[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]`
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.

## Constraints

## Algorithm
Since we can revisit any path as many times as we want, we only need to find the cheapest path on the same component as the first and last nodes.

The algorithm is a slight modification on [[Breadth-First Search|Breadth-First Search]]. Here when we come across a node, we only add it to the queue if it has not been encountered before but we do compare it's distance with the cheapest distance.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$, as we can visited every node once.
- Space: $O(n)$ for the queue and $O(n^2)$ for the adjacency list.

## Code
```cpp
auto minScore(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) -> int {
	vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adjacency_list(n);
	for (auto road: roads) {
		auto a = road[0] - 1, b = road[1] - 1, d = road[2];
		adjacency_list[a].emplace_back(b, d);
		adjacency_list[b].emplace_back(a, d);
	}

	queue<int> traverse;
	traverse.push(0);
	vector<bool> visited(n);
	visited[0] = true;

	auto cheapest_path = INT_MAX;
	while (!traverse.empty()) {
		auto a = traverse.front(); traverse.pop();
		for (auto [b, d] : adjacency_list[a]) {
			if (!visited[b]) {
				traverse.push(b);
				visited[b] = true;
			}
			cheapest_path = min(cheapest_path, d);
		}
	}

	return cheapest_path;
}
