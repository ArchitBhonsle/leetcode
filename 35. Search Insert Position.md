# 35. Search Insert Position

id:: 35
name:: Search Insert Position
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Binary Search

## Description
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Examples
**Input:** nums = `[1,3,5,6`], target = 5
**Output:** 2

**Input:** nums = `[1,3,5,6`], target = 2
**Output:** 1

**Input:** nums = `[1,3,5,6`], target = 7
**Output:** 4

## Algorithm
We binary search a number equal to or greater than the target. This can be done using the [[notes/programming/languages/cpp/Standard Library|C++ standard library]] function `lower bound` or manually writing the [[notes/programming/algorithms/Binary Search|Binary Search]].

1. We start with `l` and `r` defining an inclusive range over the entire array.
2. Inside the while loop we calculate the mid-point and compare the value at the mid-point with the target.
	1. If lesser, we reassign `l` to `m + 1` as the insertion position has to be greater than `l`.
	2. If greater, we reassign `r` to `m` as the insertion position can be `r` but not any greater.
	3. If equal, we have found the value and we return `m`.
3. We terminate the loop when the reassignments inside the loop will break the loop. This happens when `l` is just behind `r`, so we terminate the loop when we break the invariant `l < r`.
4. At the end we do need to check if the current number being pointed to by `l`. If it's lesser, then we return `l + 1` otherwise `l`.

## Code
```cpp
auto searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
	return distance(nums.begin(), lower_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), target));
}
```

```cpp
auto searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
	auto l = 0, r = (int) nums.size() - 1;

	while (l < r) {
		auto m = l + (r - l) / 2;
		if (nums[m] < target) l = m + 1;
		else if (target < nums[m]) r = m;
		else return m;
	}

	return nums[l] < target ? l + 1 : l;
}
```
