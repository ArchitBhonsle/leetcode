# 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes 

id:: 1557
name:: Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Graphs, Directed Graphs

## Description
Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.

Find _the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable_. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled22.png)
**Input:** n = 6, edges = `[[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]`
**Output:** `[0,3]`
**Explanation:** It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach `[0,1,2,5]`. From 3 we can reach `[3,4,2,5]`. So we output `[0,3]`.

### Example 2

**Input:** n = 5, edges = `[[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]`
**Output:** `[0,2,3]`
**Explanation:** Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.

## Constraints
-   $2 <= n <= 10^5$
-   $1 <= \texttt{edges.length} <= \min(10^5, \frac{n * (n - 1)}{2})$
-   $\texttt{edges[i].length} == 2$
-   $0 <= from_i, to_i < n$
-   All pairs $(from_i, to_i)$ are distinct.

## Algorithm
We simply return the vertices which do not have any incoming edges. Or to put it another way, return the vertices with an in-degree of 0.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(E)$
- Space: $O(V)$

## Code
```cpp
auto findSmallestSetOfVertices(const int n, const vector<vector<int>>& edges) -> vector<int> {
	auto indegree = vector<int>(n, 0);
	for (const auto& edge: edges) {
		const auto i = edge[0], j = edge[1];
		++indegree[j];
	}
	
	auto res = vector<int>();
	for (auto i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		if (indegree[i] == 0) res.push_back(i);
	}
	return res;
}
```
