# 2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes 

id:: 2359
name:: Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Graphs, Depth First Search

## Description
You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.

You are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.

Return the index of the node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, such that the maximum between the distance from `node1` to that node, and from `node2` to that node is minimised. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no possible answer exists, return `-1`.

Note that `edges` may contain cycles.

## Examples
**Input:** edges = `[2,2,3,-1]`, node1 = 0, node2 = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 1, and the distance from node 1 to node 2 is 1.
The maximum of those two distances is 1. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 1, so we return node 2.

**Input:** edges = `[1,2,-1]`, node1 = 0, node2 = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 2, and the distance from node 2 to itself is 0.
The maximum of those two distances is 2. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 2, so we return node 2.

## Algorithm
1. We run [[Breadth-First Search|Breadth-First Search]] on both the nodes to get distances to every other node.
2. Now we can find the node satisfying the criteria with a simple scan,

## Code
```cpp
auto closestMeetingNode(vector<int>& edges, int node1, int node2) -> int {
	auto n = edges.size();
	auto getDist = [&](size_t src) {
		vector<optional<size_t>> dist(n);

		queue<size_t> que;
		que.push(src);
		dist[src] = 0;

		while (!que.empty()) {
			auto curr = que.front(); que.pop();
			auto next = edges[curr];

			if (next == -1 || dist[next]) continue;

			que.push(next);
			dist[next] = dist[curr].value() + 1;
		}

		return dist;
	};

	auto aDist = getDist(node1), bDist = getDist(node2);
	auto currDist = (size_t) -1; 
	optional<size_t> node = nullopt;
	for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		if (!aDist[i] || !bDist[i]) continue;
		auto ai = aDist[i].value(), bi = bDist[i].value();

		if (max(ai, bi) < currDist) {
			node = i;
			currDist = max(ai, bi);    
		}
	}

	return node ? node.value() : -1;
}
```
