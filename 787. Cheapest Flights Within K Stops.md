# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops 

id:: 787
name:: Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Graphs, Weighted Graphs, 

## Description
There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops. If there is no such route, return `-1`.

## Examples
**Input:** n = 4, flights = `[[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]]`, src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
**Output:** 700
**Explanation:**
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

**Input:** n = 3, flights = `[[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]`, src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
**Output:** 200
**Explanation:**
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

## Algorithm
1. This can be solved using the [[notes/programming/algorithms/Bellman Ford Algorithm|Bellman Ford Algorithm]].
2. Instead of running the algorithm $|V| - 1$ times, we run it `k + 1` times to simulate the limitation of `k` hops. This is because `k` stops implies `k + 1` edges.

## Code
```cpp
auto findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) -> int {
	vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);
	dist[src] = 0;

	for (auto i = 0; i <= k; ++i) {
		vector<int> new_dist = dist;
		for (auto& flight : flights) {
			auto from = flight[0], to = flight[1], price = flight[2];

			if (dist[from] == INT_MAX) continue;

			new_dist[to] = min(new_dist[to], dist[from] + price);
		}
		dist = new_dist;
	}

	return dist[dst] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dist[dst];
}
```
