# 1061. Lexicographically  Smallest Equivalent String 

id:: 1061
name:: Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Union Find

## Description
You are given two strings of the same length `s1` and `s2` and a string `baseStr`.

We say `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are equivalent characters.
For example, if `s1` = "abc" and `s2` = "cde", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:
- Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
- Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
- Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.

For example, given the equivalency information from `s1` = "abc" and `s2` = "cde", "acd" and "aab" are equivalent strings of `baseStr` = "eed", and "aab" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr` by using the equivalency information from `s1` and `s2`.

## Examples
**Input:** `s1` = "parker", `s2` = "morris", `baseStr` = "parser"
**Output:** "makkek"
**Explanation:** Based on the equivalency information in `s1` and `s2`, we can group their characters as `[m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i]`.
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is "makkek".

**Input:** `s1` = "hello", `s2` = "world", `baseStr` = "hold"
**Output:** "hdld"
**Explanation:** Based on the equivalency information in `s1` and s2, `we` can group their characters as `[h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r]`.
So only the second letter 'o' in `baseStr` is changed to 'd', the answer is "hdld".

**Input:** `s1` = "leetcode", `s2` = "programs", `baseStr` = "sourcecode"
**Output:** "aauaaaaada"
**Explanation:** We group the equivalent characters in `s1` and `s2` as `[a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m]`, thus all letters in `baseStr` except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is "aauaaaaada".

## Algorithm
1. This problem can be solved using [[notes/programming/algorithms/Union Find|Union Find]].
2. Since the size of the inputs is small, we don't have to worry about optimisations.
3. However we when assigning the character to union into, we choose the lexicographically smaller character.
4. We call `Union` on all the corresponding characters in `s1` and `s2`.
5. Then we transform the `baseStr` using `Find`.

## Code
```cpp
string smallestEquivalentString(string s1, string s2, string baseStr) {
	array<int, 26> group;
	fill(group.begin(), group.end(), -1);

	function<int(int)> Find = [&](int x) {
		if (group[x] == -1) return x;
		return group[x] = Find(group[x]);
	};
	function<void(int, int)> Union = [&](int x, int y) {
		x = Find(x), y = Find(y);

		if (x != y) group[max(x, y)] = min(x, y);
	};

	for (size_t i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i)
		Union(s1[i] - 'a', s2[i] - 'a');

	transform(baseStr.begin(), baseStr.end(), baseStr.begin(), 
		[&](char c) { return Find(c - 'a') + 'a'; });

	return baseStr;
}
```
