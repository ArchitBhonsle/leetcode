# 839. Similar String Groups 

id:: 839
name:: Similar String Groups
difficulty:: Hard (Medium)
category:: Graph Search, Union Find, Components

## Description
Two strings `X` and `Y` are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of `X`, so that it equals `Y`. Also two strings `X` and `Y` are similar if they are equal.

For example, `"tars"` and `"rats"` are similar (swapping at positions `0` and `2`), and `"rats"` and `"arts"` are similar, but `"star"` is not similar to `"tars"`, `"rats"`, or `"arts"`.

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: `{"tars", "rats", "arts"}` and `{"star"}`.  Notice that `"tars"` and `"arts"` are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list `strs` of strings where every string in `strs` is an anagram of every other string in `strs`. How many groups are there?

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** strs = `["tars","rats","arts","star"]`
**Output:** 2

### Example 2
**Input:** strs = `["omv","ovm"]`
**Output:** 1

## Constraints
-   1 <= `strs.length` <= 300
-   1 <= `strs[i].length` <= 300
-   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase letters only.
-   All words in `strs` have the same length and are anagrams of each other.

## Algorithm
We can visualise these relationships as a graph and the problem is to find the number of components in this graph. Finding all the components in a graph can be done using a modified graph search, in this case, [[Breadth-First Search|Breadth-First Search]].

- The `are_similar` function checks whether two strings are "similar" under the criteria defined by the problem.
- `similar` is an adjacency list which has the index of every similar string for a given string.
- And the last block of code is the modified graph search to count the number of components in the graph.
	- Basically, maintain a `n_groups` variable is incremented every time we reach a new string in our search.
	- The `visited` vector is used to track whether a particular string has been visited.
	- So we just iterate over all the strings, skipping if the string has been visited.
	- If a string has not been visited, we perform a simple BFS over it, identifying all the connected string and marking them as visited too.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n^2)$ since we compare every possible pair of strings. The graph search only visits every string once.
- Space: $O(n^2)$ for `similar`.

## Code
```cpp
auto numSimilarGroups(vector<string>& strs) {
	auto are_similar = [](const string& a, const string& b) {
		auto count = 0;
		for (
			auto ai = a.begin(), bi = b.begin(); 
			ai < a.end() && bi < b.end();
			++ai, ++bi
		) {
			if (*ai != *bi) ++count;
		}

		return count <= 2;
	};

	vector<vector<int>> similar(strs.size());
	for (auto i = 0; i < strs.size(); ++i) {
		for (auto j = i + 1; j < strs.size(); ++j) {
			if (are_similar(strs[i], strs[j])) {
				similar[i].push_back(j);
				similar[j].push_back(i);
			}
		}
	}

	auto n_groups = 0;
	vector<bool> visited(strs.size(), false);
	for (auto start = 0; start < strs.size(); ++start) {
		if (visited[start]) continue;

		++n_groups;
		queue<int> bfs;
		bfs.push(start);
		while (!bfs.empty()) {
			auto curr = bfs.front(); bfs.pop();
			visited[curr] = true;
			
			for (const int next: similar[curr]) {
				if (visited[next]) continue;
				bfs.push(next);
			}
		}
	}

	return n_groups;
}
```
