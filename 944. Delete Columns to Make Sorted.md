# 944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted

id:: 944
name:: Delete Columns to Make Sorted
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Implementation

## Description
You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, `strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"]` can be arranged as:
```
abc
bce
cae
```

You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`) and 2 (`'c'`, `'e'`, `'e'`) are sorted while column 1 (`'b'`, `'c'`, `'a'`) is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

## Examples
**Input:** `strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]`
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
```
cba
daf
ghi
```
Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

**Input:** `strs = ["a","b"]`
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
```
a
b
```
Column 0 is the only column and is sorted, so you will not delete any columns.

**Input:** `strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]`
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
```
zyx
wvu
tsr
```
All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3.

## Algorithm
Simple implementation problem.

## Code
```go
func minDeletionSize(strs []string) int {
    nrows, ncols, ndelete := len(strs), len(strs[0]), 0

    for c := 0; c < ncols; c++ {
        last := byte(' ')
        for r := 0; r < nrows; r++ {
            if last > strs[r][c] {
                ndelete += 1
                break
            }
            last = strs[r][c]
        }
    }

    return ndelete
}
```
