# 547. Number of Provinces 

id:: 547
name:: Number of Provinces
difficulty:: Medium (Easy-Medium)
category:: Graph Traversal

## Description
There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return _the total number of **provinces**_.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph1.jpg)
**Input:** `isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]`
**Output:** 2

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph2.jpg)
**Input:** `isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]`
**Output:** 3

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n == isConnected.length`
- `n == isConnected[i].length`
- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`

## Algorithm
We basically have to count the number of [[Graph Components]]. Here we do this by running [[Breadth-First Search]] on every node if it has not been visited yet and counting the number of searches performed. This works because the graph is not directed.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(n)$

## Code
```cpp
auto findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& adj) -> int {
	const auto n = adj.size();
	auto vis = vector<bool>(n);

	auto provinces = 0;
	for (auto i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		if (vis[i]) continue;

		auto bfs = queue<int>();
		bfs.push(i);
		while (!bfs.empty()) {
			const auto j = bfs.front(); bfs.pop();
			vis[j] = true;

			for (auto k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
				if (adj[j][k] == 0 || vis[k]) 
					continue;

				bfs.push(k);
			}
		}

		++provinces;
	}

	return provinces;
}
```
