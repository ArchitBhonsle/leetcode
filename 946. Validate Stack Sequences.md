# 946. Validate Stack Sequences 

id:: 946
name:: Validate Stack Sequences
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Implementation, Stacks

## Description
Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, return `true` _if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or_ `false` _otherwise._

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** pushed = `[1,2,3,4,5]`, popped = `[4,5,3,2,1]`
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We might do the following sequence:
```
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
pop() -> 4,
push(5),
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
```

### Example 2
**Input:** pushed = `[1,2,3,4,5]`, popped = `[4,3,5,1,2]`
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** 1 cannot be popped before 2.

## Constraints
-   $1$ <= `pushed.length` <= $1000$
-   $0$ <= `pushed[i]` <= $1000$
-   All the elements of `pushed` are **unique**.
-   `popped.length == pushed.length`
-   `popped` is a permutation of `pushed`.

## Algorithm
1. Create a stack to simulate the process. Initialise two iterators, each pointing to the next element to be pushed or popped.
2. Now repeat the following till we reach the end with either of the iterators:
	1. If the stack is not empty and the current element at the top of the stack is the element to be popped, we pop it and increment the pop iterator,
	2. Otherwise push the next element to be pushed on to the stack.
3. We can never pop an element which is not pushed already so it is not possible for the push iterator to have not reached the end.
4. So now we consume the pop iterator as much as possible.
5. At the end we check whether we have reached the end of both the iterators. If yes, then the operations are possible.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(n)$

## Code
```cpp
auto validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
	stack<int> stk;
	auto pu = pushed.begin(), po = popped.begin();

	while (pu != pushed.end() && po != popped.end()) {
		if (stk.size() && stk.top() == *po) {
			stk.pop();
			++po;
			continue;
		}

		stk.push(*pu);
		++pu;
	}

	while (po != popped.end() && stk.size() && stk.top() == *po) {
		stk.pop();
		++po;
	}

	return pu == pushed.end() && po == popped.end();
}
```
