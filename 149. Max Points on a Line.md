# 149. Max Points on a Line

id:: 149
name:: Max Points on a Line
difficulty:: Hard
category:: Mathematics

## Description
Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

## Examples
**Input:** points = `[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`
**Output:** 3

**Input:** points = `[[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]`
**Output:** 4

## Algorithm
1. The constraints for this problem allow us to use the brute force the solution.
2. Every pair of points can form a line. For every such line we count the number of other points which lie on this line.
3. To check co-linearity of 3 points, we calculate the area of the triangle formed by these three points. If the area is 0, the three points are co-linear.
$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 
\begin{vmatrix}
	x1 & x2 & x3 \\ 
	y1 & y2 & y3 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 
\end{vmatrix} 
= \frac{x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)}{2}
$$
4. This is derived from the [[notes/Shoelace Formula|Shoelace Formula]].

## Code
```cpp
int maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
	int n = points.size(), res = 1;
	
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		int ix = points[i][0], iy = points[i][1];
		for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
			int curr = 2;
			int jx = points[j][0], jy = points[j][1];
			for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
				if (k == i || k == j) continue;

				int kx = points[k][0], ky = points[k][1];
				int area = ix * (jy - ky) + jx * (ky - iy) + kx * (iy - jy);
				
				if (area == 0) ++curr;
			}

			res = max(res, curr);
		}
	}

	return res;
}
