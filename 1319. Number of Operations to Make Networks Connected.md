# 1319. Number of Operations to Make Networks Connected 

id:: 1319
name:: Number of Operations to Make Networks Connected
difficulty:: Medium (Medium-Hard)
category:: Graphs, Graph Traversal, Union Find

## Description
There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n - 1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a connection between computers `ai` and `bi`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return _the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected_. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample_1_1677.png)
**Input:** n = 4, connections = `[[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]`
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample_2_1677.png)
**Input:** n = 6, connections = `[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]`
**Output:** 2

### Example 3
**Input:** n = 6, connections = `[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]`
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There are not enough cables.

## Constraints

## Algorithm
1. We find all the components of the graph like in [[notes/programming/algorithms/Union Find|union find]].
2. For every component, we find the number of spare connections. Every component only need $n - 1$ connections, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the connection.
3. If the number of spare connections is enough to connect all the components together then we can connect every node otherwise not. If there are $n$ components, we need $n - 1$ connections to connect all of them.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(V + E)$, since we are iterating over the graph's vertices and edges only once.
- Space: $O(N)$, is the space needed to store the components and the set of visited nodes. ($O(N^2)$ for the adjacency list)

## Code
```cpp
auto makeConnected(int n, vector<vector<int>>& conns) -> int {
	unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adj;
	for (const auto& conn : conns) {
		auto a = conn[0], b = conn[1];
		adj[a].push_back(b);
		adj[b].push_back(a);
	}

	vector<vector<int>> comps;
	unordered_set<int> vis;

	for (auto src = 0; src < n; ++src) {
		if (vis.count(src)) continue;

		comps.emplace_back();
		queue<int> bfs; bfs.push(src);
		vis.insert(src);

		while (!bfs.empty()) {
			auto cur = bfs.front(); bfs.pop();
			comps.back().push_back(cur);

			for (const auto& nxt : adj[cur]) {
				if (vis.count(nxt)) continue;

				vis.insert(nxt);
				bfs.push(nxt);
			}
		}
	}

	auto spare = 0;
	for (const auto& comp : comps) {
		auto comp_conns = 0;
		for (const auto& n : comp)
			comp_conns += adj[n].size();
		comp_conns /= 2;

		spare += comp_conns - (comp.size() - 1);
	}

	return spare >= comps.size() - 1 ? comps.size() - 1 : -1;
}
```
