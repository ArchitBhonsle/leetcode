# 472. Concatenated Words 

id:: 472
name:: Concatenated Words
difficulty:: Hard (Medium)
category:: Memoization

## Description
Given an array of strings `words` (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of `words`.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

## Examples
**Input:** words = `["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]`
**Output:** `["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]`
**Explanation:** "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

## Algorithm
1. We check every word by checking every possible prefix suffix pair.
	1. A prefix passes if it is in the list of words.
	2. A suffix passes if it is in the list of words or it can be recursively checked as true.
2. This is slow so we memoize the results using a simple [[Hash Set|Hash Set]].
3. Now we just filter the words list using this check function.

## Code
```cpp
auto findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(vector<string>& words) -> vector<string> {
	unordered_set<string> memo, wordsSet(words.cbegin(), words.cend());
	function<bool(string)> check = [&](string word) {
		if (memo.count(word)) {
			return true;
		}

		for (size_t i = 1; i < word.size(); ++i) {
			string prefix = word.substr(0, i), suffix = word.substr(i);

			if (wordsSet.count(prefix) && (wordsSet.count(suffix) || check(suffix))) {
				memo.insert(word);
			}
		}

		return (bool) memo.count(word);
	};

	vector<string> filtered;
	copy_if(words.begin(), words.end(), back_inserter(filtered), check);
	return filtered;
}
```
