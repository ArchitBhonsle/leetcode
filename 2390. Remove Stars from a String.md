# 2390. Remove Stars from a String 

id:: 2390
name:: Remove Stars from a String
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Implementation

## Description
You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:
- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left**, as well as remove the star itself.

Return _the string after **all** stars have been removed_.

**Note:**
- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** s = "leet**cod*e"
**Output:** "lecoe"
**Explanation:** Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "lee**t****cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "le**e***cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "leco**d***e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".

### Example 2
**Input:** s = "erase*****"
**Output:** ""
**Explanation:** The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.

## Constraints
-   $1$ <= `s.length` <= $10^5$
-   `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
-   The operation above can be performed on `s`.

## Algorithm
Straightforward.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto removeStars(string s) {
	auto del = 0;
	for (auto it = s.rbegin(); it != s.rend(); ++it) {
		if (*it == '*') {
			++del;
			continue;
		} 
		if (del > 0) {
			*it = '*';
			--del;
		}
	}

	auto end = remove(s.begin(), s.end(), '*');
	s.erase(end, s.end());

	return s;
}
```
