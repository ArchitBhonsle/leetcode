# 142. Linked List Cycle II 

id:: 142
name:: Linked List Cycle II
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Linked Lists

## Description
Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

## Examples
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** tail connects to node index 1
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
**Output:** tail connects to node index 0
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
**Output:** no cycle
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

## Algorithm
1. First, we check whether the list is empty and return `nullptr` if it is.
2. Then we traverse the linked list with two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. `slow` travels one node at a time while `fast` travels two.
3. When the two nodes meet, we keep moving `slow` one step at a time and also move another pointer `trav` from head one node at a time till they meet.
4. Because of the logic explained below, they will meet at the start of the cycle.

- Let $x$ be the distance from the head to the entry point, 
- and $y$ be the distance from the entry point to the point where `slow` and `fast` meet.
- `slow` has travelled $x + y$ nodes
- `fast` has travelled $x + y + nc$ nodes, where $n$ is the length of the cycle and $n$ is the number of times `fast` has travelled around the cycle till `slow` reached the cycle.
- Now, because `fast` travels twice the speed of `slow`, $$
\begin{align}
2 \cdot (x + y) &= x + y + nc \\
x + y &= nc \\
x &= nc - y \\
x &= (n - 1) \cdot c + (c - y)
\end{align}
$$
- Our new `entry` pointer has to travel $x$ nodes to get to the entry point while `slow` is $c - y$ nodes away.
- According to the equation `slow` will travel at least $c - y$ nodes which will take it to the entry point. 
- For all the values of $n$, `slow` will travel a multiple of $c$ nodes which will bring it back to the entry point.
- Thus, `entry` and `slow` will meet at the entry point.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
	if (head == nullptr) return head;
	
	ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
	while (fast->next != nullptr && fast->next->next != nullptr) {
		slow = slow->next;
		fast = fast->next->next;

		if (slow == fast) {
			ListNode* trav = head;
			while (slow != trav) {
				slow = slow->next;
				trav = trav->next;
			}
			return trav;
		}
	}

	return nullptr;
}
```
