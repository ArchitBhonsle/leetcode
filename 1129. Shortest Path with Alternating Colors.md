# 1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors 

id:: 1129
name:: Shortest Path with Alternating Colors
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Graph Search, BFS, Level-order traversal

## Description
You are given an integer `n`, the number of nodes in a directed graph where the nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. Each edge is red or blue in this graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.

You are given two arrays `redEdges` and `blueEdges` where:

-   `redEdges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a directed red edge from node `ai` to node `bi` in the graph, and
-   `blueEdges[j] = [uj, vj]` indicates that there is a directed blue edge from node `uj` to node `vj` in the graph.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where each `answer[x]` is the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors alternate along the path, or `-1` if such a path does not exist.

## Examples
**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, redEdges = `[[0,1],[1,2]]`, blueEdges = `[]`
**Output:** `[0,1,-1]`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, redEdges = `[[0,1]]`, blueEdges = `[[2,1]]`
**Output:** `[0,1,-1]`

## Algorithm
1. We can solve this using [[Level Order Traversal]].
2. However, we keep track of extra state for each node we push onto the queue. This extra state represents which edge we should take next.
3. We also use two arrays to keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node, one for when we arrive using a blue edge and one for red.
4. Then at the end we use information from both the arrays to create the final result array.

## Code
```cpp
auto shortestAlternatingPaths(
	int n, 
	vector<vector<int>>& redEdges, 
	vector<vector<int>>& blueEdges
) -> vector<int> { 
	map<int, vector<int>> red, blue; // reverse edges
	for (auto& edge : redEdges) red[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
	for (auto& edge : blueEdges) blue[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);

	vector<int> blueLen(n, INT_MAX), redLen(n, INT_MAX);
	queue<pair<int, bool>> bfs, bfsTemp;
	bfs.emplace(0, false);
	bfs.emplace(0, true);
	auto steps = -1;
	while (!bfs.empty()) {
		++steps;
		while (!bfs.empty()) {
			auto [ vertex, useBlue ] = bfs.front(); bfs.pop();
			
			if ((useBlue && blueLen[vertex] != INT_MAX) 
				|| (!useBlue && redLen[vertex] != INT_MAX)) continue;
			(useBlue ? blueLen : redLen)[vertex] = steps;
			
			for (const auto& edge : (useBlue ? blue : red)[vertex])
				bfsTemp.emplace(edge, !useBlue);
		}
		swap(bfs, bfsTemp);
	}

	vector<int> res(n);
	for (auto i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		res[i] = min(blueLen[i], redLen[i]);
		if (res[i] == INT_MAX) res[i] = -1;
	}

	return res;
}
