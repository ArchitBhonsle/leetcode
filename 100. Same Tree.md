# 100. Same Tree 

id:: 100
name:: Same Tree
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Binary Tree

## Description
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Examples
**Input:** p = `[1,2,3]`, q = `[1,2,3]`
**Output:** true

**Input:** p = `[1,2]` q = `[1,null,2]`
**Output:** false

**Input:** p = `[1,2,1]`, q = `[1,1,2]`
**Output:** false

## Algorithm
1. The problem can be solved using recursion.
2. There are three cases:
	1. If both the pointers are null, in which case they are equal.
	2. If both are not null, which implies equality if their values are equal and their children are recursively evaluated to be equal too.
	3. If either is null but not the other, then they are unequal.

## Code
```cpp
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (p == nullptr && q == nullptr) {
            return true;
        } else if (p != nullptr && q != nullptr) {
            return p->val == q->val 
                && isSameTree(p->left, q->left)
                && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
```
