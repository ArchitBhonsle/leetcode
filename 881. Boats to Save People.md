# 881. Boats to Save People 

id:: 881
name:: Boats to Save People
difficulty:: Medium (Easy-Medium)
category:: Sorting

## Description
You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person_.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** people = `[1,2]`, limit = 3
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 1 boat (1, 2)

### Example 2
**Input:** people = `[3,2,2,1]`, limit = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

### Example 3
**Input:** people = `[3,5,3,4]`, limit = 5
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

## Constraints
-   $1$ <= `people.length` <= $5 * 10^4$
-   $1$ <= `people[i]` <= `limit` <= $3 * 10^4$

## Algorithm
They key to solving this problem is realising that we can always carry one person. The question is whether we can fit another person alongside them.

1. Sort the people's weights.
2. Maintain two pointers, one to the beginning and one to the end.
3. Now repeat 4 to 6 until the `back` iterator is not behind the `front` iterator.
4. If the value at `front` and `back` add up to a value that fits within the limit, we increment `front` as we can fit both of them on the boat.
5. Regardless, we also move the `back` pointer one step back.
6. Every iteration we use up one boat so increment the boat count too.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
	sort(people.begin(), people.end());
	auto boats = 0;
	auto front = people.begin(), back = people.end() - 1;
	while (distance(front, back) > -1) {
		if (*front + *back <= limit) ++front;
		--back;

		++boats;
	}
	return boats;
}
```
