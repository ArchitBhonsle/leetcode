# 1372. Longest Zigzag Path in a Binary Tree 

id:: 1372
name:: Longest Zigzag Path in a Binary Tree
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Trees, Binary Trees, Tree Traversal, DFS

## Description
You are given the `root` of a binary tree.

A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

-   Choose **any** node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
-   If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
-   Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
-   Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return _the longest **ZigZag** path contained in that tree_.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_1_1702.png)
**Input:** root = `[1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]`
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_2_1702.png)
**Input:** root = `[1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]`
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).

### Example 3
**Input:** root = `[1]`
**Output:** 0

## Constraints
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range $[1, 5 * 10^4]$.
-   $1$ <= `Node.val` <= $100$

## Algorithm
The algorithm is based on [[DFS|DFS]].
1. In our recursive `dfs` function,
	1. The base case is when the `node` does not exist. Then update `result` and end this recursive call. Note that since we are detecting the end _after_ reaching a `nullptr` node, we are counting one extra node at some point and need to take care of it.
	2. If the node is not empty we check whether we are supposed to take a right turn at this node. If yes, then we take the right turn by calling the function recursively adjusting the arguments accordingly _and_ we "start" a new path at the node taking a left. If we are supposed to take a left, then the above instructions are mirrored.
2. We start the traversal at the root taking both the turns. Note that `count` here is `-1` as we need to compensate for the extra count at the end of the recursive call.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$ as we visit every node at least once.
- Space: $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree as we need that much space on the stack for the [[DFS|DFS]].

## Code
```cpp
auto longestZigZag(TreeNode* root) {
	auto result = 0;
	auto dfs = [&result](auto&& dfs, TreeNode* node, int count, bool next_right) {
		if (!node) {
			result = max(result, count);
			return;
		}

		if (next_right) {
			dfs(dfs, node->right, count + 1, false);
			dfs(dfs, node->left, 0, true);
		} else {
			dfs(dfs, node->left, count + 1, true);
			dfs(dfs, node->right, 0, false);
		}
	};
	dfs(dfs, root, -1, true);
	dfs(dfs, root, -1, false);

	return result;
}
```
