# 926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing

id:: 926
name:: Flip String to Monotone Increasing
difficulty:: Medium
category:: String, Array

## Description
A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `0`'s (possibly none), followed by some number of `1`'s (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string `s`. You can flip `s[i]` changing it from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.

Return the minimum number of flips to make `s` monotone increasing.

## Examples
**Input:** s = "00110"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We flip the last digit to get 00111.

**Input:** s = "010110"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.

**Input:** s = "00011000"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We flip to get 00000000.

## Algorithm
1. We need to create a "boundary" where all the elements on the left are `0` and all the ones on the right are `1`.
3. The initial condition is when the boundary can be considered to be at `-1` when all the `0`s are flipped to `1`s and the entire string is composed of `1`s.
4. Then we iterate from left to right moving the boundary and adjusting the number of flips based on the character consumed.
5. Every iteration we me retain the minimum number of total flips.

## Code
```cpp
int minFlipsMonoIncr(string s) {
	int flip0 = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0'),
		flip1 = 0,
		flips = flip0 + flip1;

	for (size_t boundary = 0; boundary < s.size(); ++boundary) {
		if (s[boundary] == '0') {
			flip0--;
		} else if (s[boundary] == '1') {
			flip1++;
		}
		flips = min(flips, flip0 + flip1);
	}

	return flips;
}
```
