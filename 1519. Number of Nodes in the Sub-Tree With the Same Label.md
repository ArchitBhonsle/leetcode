# 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label 

id:: 1519
name:: Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Tree, DFS

## Description
You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` `edges`. The **root** of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has **a label** which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).

The `edges` array is given on the form `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`, which means there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return _an array of size `n`_ where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the sub-tree of the `ith` node which have the same label as node `i`.

A sub-tree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.

## Examples
**Input:** n = 7, edges = `[[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]]`, labels = `"abaedcd"`
**Output:** `[2,1,1,1,1,1,1]`
**Explanation:** Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.
Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).

**Input:** n = 4, edges = `[[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]]`, labels = `"bbbb"`
**Output:** `[4,2,1,1]`
**Explanation:** The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.
The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.

**Input:** n = 5, edges = `[[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[0,4]]`, labels = `"aabab"`
**Output:** `[3,2,1,1,1]`

## Algorithm
1. This problem can be solved by [[DFS|DFS]].
2. For every node, we create a map of labels contained in it's sub-tree by recursively calling the same method on its children.
3. We merge all the children's label maps and calculate the result for the current node.
4. Now return this node's label map to it's parent.

## Code
```cpp
vector<int> countSubTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, string labels) {
	vector<vector<int>> children(n);
	for (auto& edge: edges) {
		children[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
		children[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
	}

	vector<int> res(n);
	set<int> visited;
	function<map<char, int>(int)> recurse = [&](int nodeId) {
		map<char, int> labelMap;

		if (visited.count(nodeId)) return labelMap;
		visited.insert(nodeId);

		labelMap[labels[nodeId]] += 1;
		for (auto& childId: children[nodeId]) 
			for (auto&[k, v]: recurse(childId)) labelMap[k] += v;

		res[nodeId] = labelMap[labels[nodeId]];
		return labelMap;
	};
	recurse(0);

	return res;
}
```
