# 909. Snakes and Ladders 

id:: 909
name:: Snakes and Ladders
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Graph Search, Dynamic Programming

## Description
You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `board` where the cells are labeled from `1` to `n2` in a [Boustrophedon style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. `board[n - 1][0]`) and alternating direction each row.

You start on square `1` of the board. In each move, starting from square `curr`, do the following:

-   Choose a destination square `next` with a label in the range `[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)]`.
    -   This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
-   If `next` has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `next`.
-   The game ends when you reach the square `n2`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and `n2` do not have a snake or ladder.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequentÂ snake or ladder.

-   For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.

Return the least number of moves required to reach the square `n2`. If it is not possible to reach the square, return `-1`.

## Examples
**Input:** board = `[[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]`
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.

**Input:** board = `[[-1,-1],[-1,3]]`
**Output:** 1

## Algorithm
1. The more optimal way to solve this is using [[Breadth-First Search|Breadth-First Search]].
2. Here I have solved it using [[DFS|DFS]] and memoization.
3. We recursively search all the squares and cache the best possible time to reach a particular square. 
4. We can avoid duplicate effort by not traversing a square again if the current time is worse than the memoised best time.

## Code
```cpp
auto snakesAndLadders(vector<vector<int>>& board) -> int {
	auto n = board.size();
	
	vector<int> flat; flat.reserve(n * n);
	for (auto it = board.crbegin(); it != board.crend(); ++it) {
		if (distance(board.crbegin(), it) % 2)
			copy(it->crbegin(), it->crend(), back_inserter(flat));
		else
			copy(it->cbegin(), it->cend(), back_inserter(flat));
	}

	vector<int> bestTime(n * n, -1);
	auto recurse = [&](auto&& recurse, size_t curr, size_t time) {
		auto bestTimeYet = bestTime[curr];
		if (bestTimeYet != -1 && bestTimeYet <= time) return;
		bestTime[curr] = time;

		for (size_t next = curr + 1; next < min(curr + 7, n * n); ++next) {
			auto dest = flat[next] == -1 ? next : flat[next] - 1;
			recurse(recurse, dest, time + 1);
		}
	};
	recurse(recurse, 0, 0);

	return bestTime.back();
}
