# 2360. Longest Cycle in Graph 

id:: 2360
name:: Longest Cycle in Graph
difficulty:: Hard (Medium-Hard)
category:: Graphs, Graph Traversal, Graph Cycles

## Description
You are given a **directed** graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **at most one** outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given **0-indexed** array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from node `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.

Return _the length of the **longest** cycle in the graph_. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the **same** node.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/08/graph4drawio-5.png)
**Input:** edges = `[3,3,4,2,3]`
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest cycle in the graph is the cycle: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.
The length of this cycle is 3, so 3 is returned.

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/07/graph4drawio-1.png)
**Input:** edges = `[2,-1,3,1]`
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There are no cycles in this graph.

## Constraints
-   `n == edges.length`
-   `2 <= n <= 105`
-   `-1 <= edges[i] < n`
-   `edges[i] != i`

## Algorithm
1. We maintain a `visited` array which keeps track of whether a node has been visited before or not. Instead of just keeping track of a boolean state, we keep track of the node which started the traversal that reached the node in question.
2. We iterate over all the nodes, skipping the ones which have been visited before.
3. Start a traversal from this node while keeping track of all the current path. 
4. Keep going until we encounter a previously visited note. 
5. If this previously visited node was visited in the same iteration identified by `visited`, then we search for it in the current path consider it as a cycle candidate. 

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$, as we only visit every node once.
- Space: $O(n)$, as we need $n$ space for the visited array and the path each.

## Code
```cpp
auto longestCycle(vector<int>& edges) -> int {
	vector<int> visited(edges.size(), -1);
	int maxLen = -1;
	vector<int> path;
	for (auto start = 0; start < edges.size(); ++start) {
		if (visited[start] != -1) continue;

		auto node = start;
		path.clear();
		while (true) {
			if (visited[node] != -1) {
				if (visited[node] == start) {
					auto it = find(path.begin(), path.end(), node);
					if (it != path.end()) {
						auto idx = distance(path.begin(), it);
						maxLen = max(maxLen, (int) (path.size() - idx));
					}
				}
				break;
			}
			
			visited[node] = start;
			path.push_back(node);

			if (edges[node] == -1) break;
			node = edges[node];
		}
	}
	return maxLen;
}
```
