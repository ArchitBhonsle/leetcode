# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String 

id:: 438
name:: Find All Anagrams in a String
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Strings, Sliding Window

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples
**Input:** s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
**Output:** `[0,6]`
**Explanation:**
The sub-string with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The sub-string with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

**Input:** s = "abab", p = "ab"
**Output:** `[0,1,2]`
**Explanation:**
The sub-string with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The sub-string with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The sub-string with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

## Algorithm
- We create a sliding window tracking the frequency of characters in the target string.
- Every time we move the window, we compare this with the frequency of the source string and add the index to our results if they match.

## Code
```cpp
auto findAnagrams(string target, string source) -> vector<int> {
	if (source.size() > target.size()) return {};

	array<uint, 26> tFreqs = { 0 }, sFreqs = { 0 };
	auto inc = [](array<uint, 26>& a, char c) { ++a[c - 'a']; };
	auto dec = [](array<uint, 26>& a, char c) { --a[c - 'a']; };

	for (
		auto tIt = target.begin(), sIt = source.begin();
		sIt != source.end();
		++tIt, ++sIt
	) {
		inc(tFreqs, *tIt);
		inc(sFreqs, *sIt);
	}

	vector<int> res;
	if (tFreqs == sFreqs) res.push_back(0);
	for (
		auto back = target.begin(), front = target.begin() + source.size();
		front != target.end();
		++back, ++front
	) {
		dec(tFreqs, *back);
		inc(tFreqs, *front);

		if (tFreqs == sFreqs) 
			res.push_back(distance(target.begin(), back) + 1);
	}

	return res;
}
```
