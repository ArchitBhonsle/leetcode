# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately 

id:: 1768
name:: Merge Strings Alternately
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Strings, Implementation

## Description
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string._

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
**Output:** "apbqcr"
**Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
```
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

### Example 2
**Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
**Output:** "apbqrs"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
```
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

### Example 3
**Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
**Output:** "apbqcd"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
```
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```

## Constraints
-   $1$ <= `word1.length, word2.length` <= $100$
-   `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Algorithm
This is a simple implementation problem.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n + m)$
- Space: $O(n + m)$

## Code
```cpp
auto mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
	auto res = ""s;

	auto a = word1.begin(), b = word2.begin();
	while (a != word1.end() && b != word2.end())
		res += *a++, res += *b++;
	
	while (a != word1.end()) res += *a++;
	while (b != word2.end()) res += *b++;
	
	return res;
}
```
