# 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix 

id:: 1351
name:: Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Search

## Description
Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return _the number of **negative** numbers in_ `grid`.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** `grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]`
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

### Example 2
**Input:** `grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]`
**Output:** 0

## Constraints
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

## Algorithm
In every row, we search for the first positive number. The distance to this positive number is the number of negative numbers in that row. We can repeat the same for every row but that would be $O(nm)$. 

We can improve this because of how the grid is sorted. All the negative numbers are pushed to the right and to the bottom. Because of this every row has as many or more negative numbers than the previous row. So instead of searching the whole array, we can just skip the distance of the previous search.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n + m)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto countNegatives(vector<vector<int>>& grid) -> int {
	auto positive = [](const int i) { return i >= 0; };

	auto res = 0, prev = 0;
	for (const auto& row: grid) {
		auto it = find_if(row.rbegin() + prev, row.rend(), positive);
		prev = distance(row.rbegin(), it);
		res += prev;
	}
	return res;
}
```
