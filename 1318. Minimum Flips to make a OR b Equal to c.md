# 1318. Minimum Flips to make a OR b Equal to c 

id:: 1318
name:: Minimum Flips to make a OR b Equal to c
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Bit Manipulation

## Description
Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make ( `a` OR `b` == `c` ). (bitwise OR operation).  
Flip operation consists of change **any** single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/06/sample_3_1676.png)
**Input:** a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (`a` OR `b` == `c`)

### Example 2
**Input:** a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
**Output:** 1

### Example 3
**Input:** a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
**Output:** 0

## Constraints
- $1 <= a <= 10^9$
- $1 <= b <= 10^9$
- $1 <= c <= 10^9$

## Algorithm
This question involved [[notes/Bit Manipulation#Checking a Bit|Checking a Bit]]. But basically, we iterate over corresponding bit in all the three numbers and increment our result accordingly.

If the bit in `c` is set, then we need one of bits in `b` and `c` to be set.
And if the bit is unset, then we need both the bits to be unset.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(1)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto minFlips(int a, int b, int c) -> int {
	auto res = 0;
	for (auto i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
		auto mask = 1 << i;
		auto x = (a & mask) >> i,
			y = (b & mask) >> i,
			z = (c & mask) >> i;

		res += z ? !(x | y) : (x + y);
	}
	return res;
}
```
