# 875. Koko Eating Bananas 

id:: 875. 
name:: Koko Eating Bananas
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Binary Search

## Description
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.

## Examples
**Input:** piles = `[3,6,7,11]`, h = 8
**Output:** 4

**Input:** piles = `[30,11,23,4,20]`, h = 5
**Output:** 30

**Input:** piles = `[30,11,23,4,20]`, h = 6
**Output:** 23

## Algorithm
- We binary search the correct speed between 1 and the maximum bananas in the pile.
- For checking the validity of a speed, we perform a ceiling division on every value on the pile and sum them and check if they are less than or equal to the time the guards are away.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n\log m)$, $n$ is lengths of `piles` and $m$ is the largest element in `piles`
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
	auto check = [&piles, &h](const int k) {
		return transform_reduce(
			piles.begin(), piles.end(), 0,
			[](const int sum, const int val) { return sum + val; },
			[&k](const int val) { return ((val - 1) / k) + 1;}
		) <= h;
	};

	auto low = 1, high = *max_element(piles.begin(), piles.end());
	while (low < high) {
		auto mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

		if (check(mid)) high = mid;
		else low = mid + 1;
	}
	return low;
}
```
