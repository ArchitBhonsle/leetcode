# 2140. Solving Questions with Brainpower 

id:: 2140
name:: Solving Questions with Brainpower
difficulty:: Medium (Easy-Medium)
category:: Dynamic Programming, Recursion

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [points_i, brainpower_i]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions **in order** (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. Solving question `i` will **earn** you `pointsi` points but you will be **unable** to solve each of the next `brainpoweri` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

For example, given `questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:
- If question `0` is solved, you will earn `3` points but you will be unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.
- If instead, question `0` is skipped and question `1` is solved, you will earn `4` points but you will be unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.

Return _the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam_.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** questions = `[[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]`
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.
- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2
- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points
Total points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.

### Example 2
**Input:** questions = `[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]`
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 1 and 4.
- Skip question 0
- Solve question 1: Earn 2 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 2 and 3
- Solve question 4: Earn 5 points
Total points earned: 2 + 5 = 7. There is no other way to earn 7 or more points.

## Constraints
-   $1 <= \texttt{questions.length} <= 10^5$
-   $\texttt{questions[i].length} == 2$
-   $1 <= points_i, brainpower_i <= 10^5$

## Algorithm
For every question there are two possibilities, either we solve it, for not. If we solve it we would gain points for solving the question and the points for optimally solving all the questions after skipping `brainpower[i]` questions. If we skip it then the result is the points for optimally solving rest of the questions. This results in a simple recursive function and we just take the maximum of both the cases.

This will result in a TLE because there are many repeated computations. We can avoid those by caching the results.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(n)$

## Code
```cpp
auto mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) -> long long {
	auto cache = vector<long long>(questions.size(), -1);
	auto solve = [&](auto&& solve, const size_t i) {
		if (i >= questions.size()) return 0ll;
		if (cache[i] != -1) return cache[i];

		auto without = solve(solve, i + 1);
		auto with = questions[i][0] + solve(solve, i + questions[i][1] + 1);

		return cache[i] = max(with, without);
	};
	return solve(solve, 0);
}
```
