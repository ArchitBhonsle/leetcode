# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Bust Balloons

id:: 452
name:: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons 
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Sorting, Intervals, Greedy

## Description
There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps travelling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

## Examples
**Input:** points = `[[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]`
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons `[2,8]` and `[1,6]`.
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons `[10,16]` and `[7,12]`.

**Input:** points = `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]`
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

**Input:** points = `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]`
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons `[1,2]` and `[2,3]`.
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons `[3,4]` and `[4,5]`.

## Algorithm
1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
2. Maintain a "range" where we can shoot the arrow to hit the current set of balloons. Initialise this to the first interval.
3. Now, iterate over all the intervals.
	1. If the range and the interval intersect, reduce the range to include the new interval.
	2. If not, then increase the number of arrows needed and set this new interval as the new range.
4. The base implementation of this algorithm has two exceptions,
	1. The last set of balloons is not counter because we never come across a non-intersecting interval after this.
	2. If there is only one interval, the arrow for it is never counted as we never encounter a non-intersecting interval. This can be combated by adding a special condition to check for this.
 5. Both of these can be fixed by simply starting the arrows count at 1 instead of 0.

## Code
```cpp
int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
	vector<pair<int, int>> intervals;
	transform(
		points.begin(),
		points.end(), 
		back_inserter(intervals),
		[](vector<int> p) { return make_pair(p[0], p[1]); }
	);
	sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

	int arrows = 1;
	pair<int, int> range = intervals[0];
	for (auto& [is, ie] : intervals) {
		auto& [rs, re] = range;

		if (is <= re) {
			range = { is, min(ie, re) };
		} else {
			++arrows;
			range = { is, ie };
		}
	}

	return arrows;
}
```
