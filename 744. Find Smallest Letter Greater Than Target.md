# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target 

id:: 744
name:: Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Binary Search

## Description
You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and a character `target`. There are **at least two different** characters in `letters`.

Return _the smallest character in_ `letters` _that is lexicographically greater than_ `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** `letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"`
**Output:** "c"
**Explanation:** The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

### Example 2
**Input:** `letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"`
**Output:** "f"
**Explanation:** The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.

### Example 3
**Input:** `letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"`
**Output:** "x"
**Explanation:** There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return `letters[0]`.

## Constraints
- $2 <= letters.length <= 10^4$
- `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `letters` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
- `letters` contains at least two different characters.
- `target` is a lowercase English letter.

## Algorithm
This is a simple [[notes/Binary Search]] problem.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(\log n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) -> char {
   auto it = upper_bound(letters.begin(), letters.end(), target);
   return *(it == letters.end() ? letters.begin(): it);
}
```
[[notes/STL Algorithms#upper_bound]]

```cpp
auto nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) -> char {
	if (target >= letters.back()) return letters.front();

	auto low = letters.begin(), high = letters.end() - 1;
	while (distance(low, high) > 0) {
		auto mid = low + distance(low, high) / 2;
		if (*mid <= target) low = mid + 1;
		else high = mid;
	}

	return *high;
}
```
