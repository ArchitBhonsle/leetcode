# 1402. Reducing Dishes 

id:: 1402
name:: Reducing Dishes
difficulty:: Hard (Easy-Medium)
category:: Sorting, Problem Solving

## Description
A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

**Like-time coefficient** of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. `time[i] * satisfaction[i]`.

Return _the maximum sum of **like-time coefficient** that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation_.

Dishes can be prepared in **any** order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** satisfaction = `[-1,-8,0,5,-9]`
**Output:** 14
**Explanation:** After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total **like-time coefficient** will be equal to `(-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14)`.
Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.

### Example 2
**Input:** satisfaction = `[4,3,2]`
**Output:** 20
**Explanation:** Dishes can be prepared in any order, `(2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)`

### Example 3
**Input:** satisfaction = `[-1,-4,-5]`
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared.

## Constraints
-   `n == satisfaction.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 500`
-   `-1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000`

## Ideas
- It makes sense to cook the dishes in sorted order.
- Doing dishes with negative _satisfaction_ is a trade-off as doing negative dishes reduces the _like-time coefficient_, we get increases benefit from the higher _satisfaction_ dishes.
- We need to figure out a way to gauge this trade-off.
- Since we will only drop dishes from the left (in sorted order), we can check all the possible "drop points" (index where we drop everything to its left).
- To do this we need a fast way to compute the new _like-time coefficient_. Maybe [[notes/programming/data-structure/Prefix Sum|prefix sum]]?
- Conveniently, we only need the sum of the elements to the right of the _drop point_ to calculate the new _like-time coefficient_.

## Algorithm
1. First, we sort `satisfaction`.
2. `rem_sum` is the sum of all the elements to the right of and including the _drop point_. Initially, it is sum of all the elements.
3. We calculate `score` without dropping any element.
4. Then we move our _drop point_ from left to right, using `rem_sum` to calculate the new `score` efficiently.
5. We update `score` if the new `score` is higher.
6. We update `rem_sum` to exclude the element dropped now which allows us to calculate the next `score` quickly.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto maxSatisfaction(vector<int>& satisfaction) -> int {
	sort(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end());
	auto rem_sum = reduce(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end(), 0);

	auto score = 0;
	for (auto time = 1; time <= satisfaction.size(); ++time)
		score += time * satisfaction[time - 1];

	for (auto drop = 0; drop < satisfaction.size(); ++drop) {
		score = max(score, score - rem_sum);
		rem_sum -= satisfaction[drop];
	}

	return score;
}
```
