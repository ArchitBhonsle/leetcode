# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers 

id:: 129
name:: Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Binary Trees, Tree Traversal

## Description
You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

-   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num1tree.jpg)
**Input:** root = `[1,2,3]`
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num2tree.jpg)
Input: root = `[4,9,0,5,1]`
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

## Constraints
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
-   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

## Algorithm
This is a simple [[DFS|DFS]] problem.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes. DFS is called for every node.
- Space: $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree and is the space occupied by the call stack.

## Code
```cpp
auto sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
	int sum = 0;
	auto dfs = [&sum](auto&& dfs, TreeNode* node, int num) {
		num = num * 10 + node->val;

		if (!node->left && !node->right) {
			sum += num;
			return;
		}

		if (node->left) dfs(dfs, node->left, num);
		if (node->right) dfs(dfs, node->right, num);
	};

	if (root) dfs(dfs, root, 0);
	return sum;
}
```
