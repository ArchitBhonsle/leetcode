# 785. Is Graph Bipartite? 

id:: 785
name:: Is Graph Bipartite?
difficulty:: Medium (Easy-Medium)
category:: Graphs, Undirected Graphs

## Description
There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:
-   There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
-   There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
-   If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
-   The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` _if and only if it is **bipartite**_.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi2.jpg)
**Input:** graph = `[[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]`
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi1.jpg)
**Input:** graph = `[[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]`
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can partition the nodes into two sets: `{0, 2}` and `{1, 3}`.

## Constraints
-   `graph.length == n`
-   `1 <= n <= 100`
-   `0 <= graph[u].length < n`
-   `0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1`
-   `graph[u]` does not contain `u`.
-   All the values of `graph[u]` are **unique**.
-   If `graph[u]` contains `v`, then `graph[v]` contains `u`.

## Algorithm
This is a simple graph traversal but instead of just marking the nodes as "visited", we also maintain a `color` for each vertex. And during our traversal, we also make sure that `color`s of two adjacent vertices are different.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(V + E)$
- Space: $O(V)$

## Code
```cpp
auto isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) -> bool {
	auto color = vector<int>(graph.size(), 0); // -1 = blue, 1 = red, 0 = not visited

	for (auto start = 0; start < graph.size(); ++start) {
		if (color[start] != 0) continue;

		auto bfs = queue<int>();
		bfs.push(start);
		color[start] = 1;
		while (!bfs.empty()) {
			auto curr = bfs.front(); bfs.pop();

			for (const auto next: graph[curr]) {
				if (color[next] == 0) {
					color[next] = -1 * color[curr];
					bfs.push(next);
				}

				if (-1 * color[curr] != color[next]) {
					return false;
				}
			}
		}
	}

	return true;
}
```
