# 1675. Minimise Deviation in Array 

id:: 1675. 
name:: Minimise Deviation in Array
difficulty:: Hard (Medium)
category:: Ordered Sets, Greedy Approach

## Description
You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

-   If the element is **even**, **divide** it by `2`.
     For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3,2].`
-   If the element is **odd**, **multiply** it by `2`.
    For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[2,2,3,4].`

The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two elements in the array.

Return _the **minimum deviation** the array can have after performing some number of operations._

## Examples
**Input:** nums = `[1,2,3,4]`
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You can transform the array to `[1,2,3,2]`, then to `[2,2,3,2]`, then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.

**Input:** nums = `[4,1,5,20,3]`
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You can transform the array after two operations to `[4,2,5,5,3]`, then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.

**Input:** nums = `[2,10,8]`
**Output:** 3

## Algorithm
We need to realise that the "multiply" operation can only happen once to all the odd numbers. If we perform this operation in the beginning, we only have to worry about the "divide" operation (which can only be performed on odd number).

1. We insert all the elements from `nums` into an [[notes/programming/data-structure/Ordered Set|ordered set]] and multiplying all the odd number by 2.
2. The maximum deviation would be the difference between the first and the last element in the set which are the smallest and the largest numbers respectively.
3. We can decrease this deviation by reducing the largest number which can be done by dividing it by 2 if it's even.
4. So we loop until the last element is even and recalculating the deviation.

## Code
```cpp
auto minimumDeviation(vector<int>& nums) -> int {
	set<int> sorted;
	transform(
		nums.begin(), nums.end(), inserter(sorted, sorted.end()),
		[](const int& n) { return n % 2 == 0 ? n : n * 2; }
	);

	auto diff = *sorted.rbegin() - *sorted.begin();
	while (*sorted.rbegin() % 2 == 0) {
		sorted.insert(*sorted.rbegin() / 2);
		sorted.erase(*sorted.rbegin());
		diff = min(diff, *sorted.rbegin() - *sorted.begin());
	}

	return diff;
}
```
