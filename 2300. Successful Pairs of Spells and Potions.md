# 2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions 

id:: 2300
name:: Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions
difficulty:: Medium (Easy-Medium)
category:: Sorting, Binary Search

## Description
You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m` respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the `ith` spell and `potions[j]` represents the strength of the `jth` potion.

You are also given an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair is considered **successful** if the **product** of their strengths is **at least** `success`.

Return _an integer array_ `pairs` _of length_ `n` _where_ `pairs[i]` _is the number of **potions** that will form a successful pair with the_ `ith` _spell._

## Examples
### Example 1
_Input:_ spells = `[5,1,3]`, potions = `[1,2,3,4,5]`, success = 7
_Output:_ `[4,0,3]`
_Explanation:_
- 0th spell: 5 * `[1,2,3,4,5]` = `[5,_10_,_15_,_20_,_25_]`. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * `[1,2,3,4,5]` = `[1,2,3,4,5]`. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * `[1,2,3,4,5]` = `[3,6,_9_,_12_,_15_]`. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, `[4,0,3]` is returned.

### Example 2
_Input:_ spells = `[3,1,2]`, potions = `[8,5,8]`, success = 16
_Output:_ `[2,0,2]`
_Explanation:_
- 0th spell: 3 * `[8,5,8]` = `[_24_,15,_24_]`. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * `[8,5,8]` = `[8,5,8]`. 0 pairs are successful. 
- 2nd spell: 2 * `[8,5,8]` = `[_16_,10,_16_]`. 2 pairs are successful. 
Thus, `[2,0,2]` is returned.

## Constraints
-   `n == spells.length`
-   `m == potions.length`
-   `1 <= n, m <= 105`
-   `1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105`
-   `1 <= success <= 1010`

## Algorithm
For every spell there is a threshold potion strength above which all potions are of successful. We can find this threshold potion strength for every spell and [[notes/programming/algorithms/Binary Search|binary search]] the boundary above which all the potions are stronger than this threshold value and return their count.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(m\log m + n)$, where $n$ is the number of spells and $m$ is the number of potions.
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto successfulPairs(vector<int>& spells, vector<int>& potions, long long success) -> vector<int> {
	sort(potions.begin(), potions.end());

	vector<int> result;
	transform(
		spells.begin(), spells.end(), back_inserter(result),
		[&potions, success](const int spell) {
			long long min_potion = (success / spell) + ((success % spell != 0) ? 1 : 0);
			return distance(
				lower_bound(potions.begin(), potions.end(), min_potion),
				potions.end()
			);
		}
	);
	
	return result;
}
```
