# 997. Find the Twon Judge 

id:: 997
name:: Find the Twon Judge
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Graphs

## Description
In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:
1.  The town judge trusts nobody.
2.  Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3.  There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labelled `bi`.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return `-1` _otherwise_.

## Examples

**Input:** n = 2, trust = `[[1,2]]`
**Output:** 2

**Input:** n = 3, trust = `[[1,3],[2,3]]`
**Output:** 3

**Input:** n = 3, trust = `[[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]`
**Output:** -1

## Algorithm
1. We create a vector containing the information on how may people a person trusts and how many people they are trusted by.
2. Then we just search the array for the person that qualifies the criteria for being a town judge.

## Code
```cpp
auto findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) -> int {
	// (how many people the person trusts, how many people the person is trusted by)
	vector<pair<int, int>> trustProfile(n); 

	for (auto& t: trust) {
		auto a = t[0], b = t[1];
		++trustProfile[a - 1].first;
		++trustProfile[b - 1].second;
	}

	auto judgeIt = find(
		trustProfile.begin(), trustProfile.end(),
		make_pair(0, n - 1)
	);

	return judgeIt == trustProfile.end() 
		? -1
		: distance(trustProfile.begin(), judgeIt) + 1;
}
```
