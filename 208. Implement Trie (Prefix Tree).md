# 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) 

id:: 208
name:: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Trie

## Description

## Examples

## Constraints

## Algorithm
This is a simple implementation problem where we create a [[notes/programming/data-structure/Trie|trie]]. The `Trie` consists of the root `Node`. Every `Node` has two fields: `isLast` and `children`.
- `isLast` indicates whether a word terminates at that `Node`.
- `children` is an [[programming/languages/cpp/array|array]] of 26 `Node*`s where each map to an alphabet. `nullptr` is used to indicate whether a `Node` has been created for that letter or not.

Rest of the implementation is explained in the code.

## Complexity
- Insert:
	- Time: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the word as we may have to create nodes for every letter in that word.
	- Space: $O(n)$, same reason as above.
- Find:
	- Time: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the word as we have to traverse the nodes for every letter in the word.
	- Space: $O(1)$, as searching requires no extra space.

## Code

> [!NOTE] Pointers are bad!
> The following code is sub-optimal as we can achieve the same result by using `optional` and references avoid any heap allocations and possibility of pointer blunders.

```cpp
lass Node {
    auto getIdx(char c) { return c - 'a'; }
    array<Node*, 26> children;
public:
    bool isLast;

    Node(): isLast{false}, children{nullptr} {}

    Node* insert(char c) {
        auto idx = getIdx(c);
        if (!children[idx]) {
            children[idx] = new Node();
        }

        return children[idx];
    }

    Node* get(char c) {
        return children[getIdx(c)];
    }
};

class Trie {
    Node root;
public:
    Trie() {}
    
    void insert(string word) {
        auto node = &root;
        for (auto c : word)
            node = node->insert(c);
        node->isLast = true;
    }
    
    bool search(string word) {
        auto node = &root;
        for (auto c : word) {
            node = node->get(c);
            if (!node) return false;
        }
        return node->isLast;
    }
    
    bool startsWith(string prefix) {
        auto node = &root;
        for (auto c : prefix) {
            node = node->get(c);
            if (!node) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
