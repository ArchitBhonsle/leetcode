# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range 

id:: 1523
name:: Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
difficulty:: Easy 
category:: Maths

## Description
Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the _count of odd numbers between_ `low` _and_ `high`Â _(inclusive)_.

## Examples
**Input:** low = 3, high = 7
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are `[3,5,7]`.

**Input:** low = 8, high = 10
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are `[9]`.

## Algorithm
1. We fix the interval's boundaries inwards towards odd numbers.
2. The number of odd numbers in this range is just one more than half the size of the interval.

## Code
```cpp
auto countOdds(int low, int high) {
	return ((high % 2 ? high : high - 1) - (low % 2 ? low : low + 1)) / 2 + 1;
}
```
