# 2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I 

id:: 2554
name:: Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Greedy

## Description
You are given an integer array `banned` and two integers `n` and `maxSum`. You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

-   The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.
-   Each integer can be chosen **at most once**.
-   The chosen integers should not be in the array `banned`.
-   The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`.

Return _the **maximum** number of integers you can choose following the mentioned rules_.

## Examples
**Example 1:**

**Input:** banned = `[1,6,5]`, n = 5, maxSum = 6
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You can choose the integers 2 and 4.
2 and 4 are from the range `[1, 5]`, both did not appear in banned, and their sum is 6, which did not exceed maxSum.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** banned = `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`, n = 8, maxSum = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You cannot choose any integer while following the mentioned conditions.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** banned = `[11]`, n = 7, maxSum = 50
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** You can choose the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
They are from the range `[1, 7]`, all did not appear in banned, and their sum is 28, which did not exceed maxSum.

## Algorithm
We maintain a running sum while iterating from 1 to n while excluding numbers from the ban set and breaking when we hit `maxSum`.

## Code
```cpp
auto maxCount(vector<int>& banned, int n, int maxSum) -> int {
	unordered_set<int> banSet(banned.begin(), banned.end());
	
	auto res = 0, sum = 0;
	for (auto i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
		if (banSet.count(i)) continue;
		
		if (sum + i > maxSum) break;

		sum += i;
		++res;
	}
	
	return res;
}
```
