# 1675. Minimise Deviation in Array 

id:: 1675
name:: Minimise Deviation in Array
difficulty:: Hard (Medium)
category:: Greedy Approach, Ordered Sets

## Description
You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

-   If the element is **even**, **divide** it by `2`.
    For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3,2].`
-   If the element is **odd**, **multiply** it by `2`.
    For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[2,2,3,4].`

The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two elements in the array.

Return _the **minimum deviation** the array can have after performing some number of operations._

## Examples
**Input:** nums = `[1,2,3,4]`
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You can transform the array to `[1,2,3,2]`, then to `[2,2,3,2]`, then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.

**Input:** nums = `[4,1,5,20,3]`
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You can transform the array after two operations to `[4,2,5,5,3]`, then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.

**Input:** nums = `[2,10,8]`
**Output:** 3

## Algorithm
First we realise that the "multiply" operation can only be performed once meaningfully. So we perform that as a pre-processing step  so we only need to worry about the "divide" operation.

1. We put all the numbers in an [[notes/programming/data-structure/Ordered Set|ordered set]] while multiplying all the odd numbers by 2.
2. Then the deviation is the difference between the first and last element of the set.
3. Now, we keep on dividing the largest element by 2 until we reach an odd largest number, keeping track all the deviations.

## Code
```cpp
auto minimumDeviation(vector<int>& nums) -> int {
	set<int> sorted;
	transform(
		nums.begin(), nums.end(), inserter(sorted, sorted.end()),
		[](const int& n) { return n % 2 == 0 ? n : n * 2; }
	);

	auto diff = *sorted.rbegin() - *sorted.begin();
	while (*sorted.rbegin() % 2 == 0) {
		sorted.insert(*sorted.rbegin() / 2);
		sorted.erase(*sorted.rbegin());
		diff = min(diff, *sorted.rbegin() - *sorted.begin());
	}

	return diff;
}
```
