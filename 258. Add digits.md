# 258. Add digits 

id:: 258
name:: Add digits
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Implementation

## Description
Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** num = 38
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

### Example 2
**Input:** num = 0
**Output:** 0

## Constraints
-   $0$ <= `num` <= $2^{31} - 1$

## Algorithm
This is straightforward implementation problem. Here I have implemented it using recursion but it can be easily implemented using iteration as well.

There is another very obtuse solution to this problem which solves it in $O(1)$ time based on [Digital root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root)

## Complexity
- Time: $O(\log \log n)$ assuming every call halves the number of digits
- Space: $O(\log \log n)$ as there will be as many recursive calls as the number of times the number of digits is halved

## Code
```cpp
auto addDigits(int num) {
	if (num < 10) return num;

	auto sum = 0;
	while (num != 0) {
		sum += num % 10;
		num /= 10;
	}

	return addDigits(sum);
}
```

### Digital Root Approach
I have no idea how this works
```c++
auto addDigits(int num) {
  if (num == 0) return 0;
  else if (num % 9 == 0) return 9;
  else return num % 9;
}
```
