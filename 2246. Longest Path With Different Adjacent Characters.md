# 2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters 

id:: 2246
name:: Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters
difficulty:: Hard
category:: Tree, DFS

## Description
You are given a **tree** (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) **rooted** at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.

## Examples
**Input**: parent = `[-1,0,0,1,1,2]`, s = "abacbe"
**Output**: 3
**Explanation**: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions. 

**Input**: parent = `[-1,0,0,0]`, s = "aabc"
**Output**: 3
**Explanation**: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.

## Algorithm
1. This problem can be solved using [[DFS|DFS]].
2. First, we convert the parent list into a children list. This makes running DFS easier.
3. Outside the DFS lambda we maintain a `res` variable that tracks the largest path found so far.
4. Inside the DFS function, we find the length of the two largest paths to leaf for each of the node's children. 
5. Note that children with the same label as the parent should be skipped as the violate the condition specified in the problem statement.
6. Attaching these two paths to the current node, gives us the largest path possible at the current node. We update the `res` variable accordingly.
7. Finally, we return the length of the longest path to a leaf from the current node. 

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPath(vector<int>& parent, string s) {
        vector<vector<int>> edges(parent.size());
        for (int i = 1; i < parent.size(); ++i)
            edges[parent[i]].push_back(i);

        int res = 0;
        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int nodeId) {
            int first = 0, second = 0;
            for (auto& childNodeId: edges[nodeId]) {
                int childPathLen = dfs(childNodeId);

                if (s[nodeId] == s[childNodeId]) continue;

                if (childPathLen >= first) {
                    second = first;
                    first = childPathLen;
                } else if (childPathLen > second) {
                    second = childPathLen;
                }
            }
            res = max(res, 1 + first + second);

            return 1 + first;
        };
        dfs(0);

        return res;
    }
};
```
