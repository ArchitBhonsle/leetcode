# 2306. Naming a Company 

id:: 2306
name:: Naming a Company
difficulty:: Hard
category::

## Description
You are given an array of strings `ideas` that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:

1.  Choose 2 **distinct** names from `ideas`, call them `ideaA` and `ideaB`.
2.  Swap the first letters of `ideaA` and `ideaB` with each other.
3.  If **both** of the new names are not found in the original `ideas`, then the name `ideaA ideaB` (the **concatenation** of `ideaA` and `ideaB`, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
4.  Otherwise, it is not a valid name.

Return _the number of **distinct** valid names for the company_.

## Examples
**Input:** ideas = `["coffee","donuts","time","toffee"]`
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** 
The following selections are valid:
- ("coffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee conuts".
- ("donuts", "coffee"): The company name created is "conuts doffee".
- ("donuts", "time"): The company name created is "tonuts dime".
- ("donuts", "toffee"): The company name created is "tonuts doffee".
- ("time", "donuts"): The company name created is "dime tonuts".
- ("toffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee tonuts".
Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.

The following are some examples of invalid selections:
- ("coffee", "time"): The name "toffee" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.
- ("time", "toffee"): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.
- ("coffee", "toffee"): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.

**Input:** ideas = `["lack","back"]`
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no valid selections. Therefore, 0 is returned.

## Algorithm
1. We create a mapping from every possible first character to all its suffixes.
2. Then we consider all the possible pairs of first characters.
3. For each pair, we need to exclude the common suffixes when we count the eligible company names.
4. The number of possible company names is the product of sizes of each of the suffix sets.
5. Before we take the product of the two sizes, we need to subtract the number of common elements between the two suffix sets.
6. We have to multiply our result by `2` if we eliminated all the symmetric pairs in step 2.

## Code
```cpp
auto distinctNames(vector<string>& ideas) -> int64_t {
	unordered_map<char, unordered_set<string_view>> firstToSuffix;
	for (const auto& idea : ideas)
		firstToSuffix[idea[0]].insert(string_view{idea}.substr(1));

	int64_t res = 0;
	for (auto i = firstToSuffix.begin(); i != firstToSuffix.end(); ++i) {
		for (auto j = next(i); j != firstToSuffix.end(); ++j) {
			auto common = count_if(
				i->second.begin(), i->second.end(),
				[&j](const auto& x) { return j->second.count(x); }
			);

			res += (i->second.size() - common) * (j->second.size() - common);
		}
	}
	return res * 2;
}
```
