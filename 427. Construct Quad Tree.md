# 427. Construct Quad Tree 

id:: 427
name:: Construct Quad Tree
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Implementation, Recursion

## Description
Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return _the root of the Quad-Tree_ representing the `grid`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

-   `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
-   `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

```
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

1.  If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
2.  If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
3.  Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

## Examples
**Quad-Tree format:**

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.

**Input:** grid = `[[0,1],[1,0`]]
**Output:** `[[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0`]]
**Explanation:** The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represents `False` and 1 represents `True` in the [photo](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/11/grid1.png) representing the Quad-Tree.

**Input:** grid = `[[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0`]]
**Output:** `[[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1`]]
**Explanation:** All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The `topLeft`, `bottomLeft` and `bottomRight` each has the same value.
The `topRight` have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the [photo](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/e2tree.png).

## Algorithm
1. We create a recursive function that has access to the entire grid and the delimiters for the range it is expected to process.
2. If the size of this delimited range is 1 then we simply return a leaf node with the corresponding value.
3. Otherwise, we recursively calculate the nodes for all it's children ranges.
4. If all the child ranges are leafs and if all their values are equal, then we can collapse them into a single node with the same value.
5. If not, then we return the a non-leaf node with some value and all its children.

## Code
```cpp
auto construct(vector<vector<int>>& grid) -> Node* {
	auto recurse = [&grid](auto&& recurse, int ax, int bx, int ay, int by) {
		assert(bx - ax == by - ay);
		auto n = bx - ax;
		if (n == 1)
			return new Node(grid[ay][ax] == 1, true);

		auto cx = (ax + bx) / 2, cy = (ay + by) / 2;
		auto tl = recurse(recurse, ax, cx, ay, cy),
			tr = recurse(recurse, cx, bx, ay, cy),
			bl = recurse(recurse, ax, cx, cy, by),
			br = recurse(recurse, cx, bx, cy, by);

		// if all its children are leafs
		if ((tl->isLeaf && tr->isLeaf && bl->isLeaf && br->isLeaf) == true) {
			// all are 1s
			if ((tl->val && tr->val && bl->val && br->val) == true)
				return new Node(true, true);
			// all are 0s
			if ((tl->val || tr->val || bl->val || br->val) == false)
				return new Node(false, true);
		}

		return new Node(true, false, tl, tr, bl, br);
	};

	return recurse(recurse, 0, grid.size(), 0, grid.size());
}
```
