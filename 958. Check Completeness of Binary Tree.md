# 958. Check Completeness of Binary Tree 

id:: 958
name:: Check Completeness of Binary Tree
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Binary Trees, Level Order Traversal

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a _complete binary tree_.

In a **[complete binary tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)
**Input:** root = `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Every level before the last is full (i.e. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)
**Input:** root = `[1,2,3,4,5,null,7]`
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.

## Constraints
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Algorithm
We [[Level Order Traversal|level order traverse]] over the tree and for every level we check whether that level is complete. If it is not complete if the next level is empty and if the current level is filled from left to right.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(2^h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree as we perform quite a few computations on all the nodes on a level.
- Space: $O(2^h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree as $2^h$ is the number of nodes in the lowest level.

## Code
```cpp
auto isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
	if (!root) return true;

	deque<TreeNode*> bfs, bfsTemp;
	bfs.push_back(root);
	int level = 0;
	while (!bfs.empty()) {
		auto currentComplete = count_if(
			bfs.begin(), bfs.end(),
			[](const TreeNode* node) { return node != nullptr; }
		) == pow(2, level);

		auto currentCorrect = is_partitioned(
			bfs.begin(), bfs.end(),
			[](const TreeNode* node) { return node != nullptr; }
		);

		while (!bfs.empty()) {
			auto node = bfs.front(); bfs.pop_front();
			if (!node) continue;
			
			bfsTemp.push_back(node->left);
			bfsTemp.push_back(node->right);
		}

		if (!currentComplete) {
			auto nextNonNulls = count_if(
				bfsTemp.begin(), bfsTemp.end(),
				[](const TreeNode* node) { return node != nullptr; }
			);
			
			return (nextNonNulls == 0) && currentCorrect;
		}

		swap(bfs, bfsTemp);
		++level;
	}

	return true;
}
```
