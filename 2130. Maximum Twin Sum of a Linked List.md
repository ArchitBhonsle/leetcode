# 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List 

id:: 2130
name:: Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Linked Lists

## Description
In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return _the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list_.

## Examples
**Input:** head = `[5,4,2,1]`
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.

## Constraints
### Example 1
**Input:** head = `[5,4,2,1]`
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.

### Example 2
**Input:** head = `[4,2,2,3]`
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:**
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7.

### Example 3
**Input:** head = `[1,100000]`
**Output:** 100001
**Explanation:**
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.

## Algorithm
Store all the elements in an array and calculate the answer. There is a smarter approach to this with stack and slow and fast pointers but it has the same complexity.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(n)$

## Code
```cpp
auto pairSum(const ListNode* head) -> int {
	auto list = vector<int>();
	auto trav = head;
	while (trav != nullptr) {
		list.push_back(trav->val);
		trav = trav->next;
	}

	auto front = list.cbegin();
	auto back = list.crbegin();
	auto res = INT_MIN;
	while (distance(list.cbegin(), front) < list.size() / 2)
		res = max(res, *front++ + *back++);

	return res;
}
```
