# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary 

id:: 953
name:: Verifying an Alien Dictionary
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Strings

## Description
In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

## Examples
**Input:** words = `["hello","leetcode"]`, order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

**Input:** words = `["word","world","row"]`, order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

**Input:** words = `["apple","app"]`, order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character ([More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order)).

## Algorithm
1. We just map each word by substituting all the characters with their indices. 
2. Then we check if it is sorted.

## Code
```cpp
auto isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
	array<size_t, 26> mapping;
	for (size_t i = 0; i < order.size(); ++i) mapping[order[i] - 'a'] = i;

	vector<vector<size_t>> mapped; mapped.reserve(words.size());
	transform(
		words.begin(), words.end(), back_inserter(mapped),
		[&](const string& word) {
			vector<size_t> m; m.reserve(word.size());
			transform(
				word.begin(), word.end(), back_inserter(m),
				[&](const char& c) { return mapping[c - 'a']; }
			);
			return m;
		}
	);

	return is_sorted(mapped.begin(), mapped.end());
}
```
