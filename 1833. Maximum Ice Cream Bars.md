# 1833. Maximum Ice Cream Bars

id:: 1833
name:: Maximum Ice Cream Bars
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Sorting, Greedy

## Description
It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.

At the store, there are `n` ice cream bars. You are given an array `costs` of length `n`, where `costs[i]` is the price of the `ith` ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has `coins` coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible.Â 

Return the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with `coins` _coins._

Note: The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.

## Examples
**Input:** costs = `[1,3,2,4,1]`, coins = 7
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.

**Input:** costs = `[10,6,8,7,7,8]`, coins = 5
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.

**Input:** costs = `[1,6,3,1,2,5]`, coins = 20
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.

## Algorithm
1. Sort the costs in ascending order.
2. Now greedily buy ice-cream till you are out of coins.

## Code
```cpp
int maxIceCream(vector<int>& costs, int coins) {
	sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
	long acc = 0l, res = 0;
	for (auto& c : costs) {
		acc += c;
		if (acc > coins) return res;
		++res;
	}
	return res;
}
```
