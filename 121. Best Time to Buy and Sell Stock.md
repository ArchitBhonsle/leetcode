# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 

id:: 121
name:: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Greedy Approach

## Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Examples
**Input:** prices = `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Input:** prices = `[7,6,4,3,1]`
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

## Algorithm
Traverse the prices while maintaining the lowest price so far and the best deal so far, updating both accordingly.

## Code
```cpp
auto maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
	auto res = INT_MIN, low = prices[0];
	for (auto price : prices) {
		if (low <= price) res = max(res, price - low);
		low = min(low, price);
	}
	return res;
}
```
