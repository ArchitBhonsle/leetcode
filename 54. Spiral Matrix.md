# 54. Spiral Matrix 

id:: 54
name:: Spiral Matrix
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Implementation

## Description
Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return _all elements of the_ `matrix` _in spiral order_.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/spiral1.jpg)
**Input:** matrix = `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
**Output:** `[1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]`

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/spiral.jpg)
**Input:** matrix = `[[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]`
**Output:** `[1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]`

## Constraints
-   `m == matrix.length`
-   `n == matrix[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 10`
-   `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

## Algorithm
The idea behind the solution is to implement the spiral walk. To do this we use a boolean matrix `v` which tracks the elements that have already been added. To perform the walk we keep track of the current element's position, `x` and `y` and the direction of our next step, `dx` and `dy`. The function `nd` updates this direction according to the rules of the spiral.

The walk is a `while` loop which traverses the matrix, marking the elements as visited and adding them to the result `vector`. However, we make sure that we are not going out of the matrix or stepping on an already visited element. If that happens we change the direction using `nd`. We also check if this element in the new direction violates any of the same conditions. If it does we `break` the loop. 

## Complexity
- Time: $O(nm)$
- Space: $O(nm)$

## Code
```cpp
vector<int> spiralOrder(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
	auto x = 0, y = 0;

	auto dx = 1, dy = 0;
	auto nd = [&dx, &dy]() {
		if (dx == 1 && dy == 0) dx = 0, dy = 1;
		else if (dx == 0 && dy == 1) dx = -1, dy = 0;
		else if (dx == -1 && dy == 0) dx = 0, dy = -1;
		else if (dx == 0 && dy == -1) dx = 1, dy = 0;
	};

	auto X = (int) matrix[0].size(), Y = (int) matrix.size();
	vector<vector<bool>> v(Y, vector<bool>(X, false));
	v[y][x] = false;

	vector<int> res;
	while (true) {
		v[y][x] = true;
		res.push_back(matrix[y][x]);

		auto nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
		if (nx < 0 || nx >= X || ny < 0 || ny >= Y || v[ny][nx]) {
			nd();
			nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
			if (nx < 0 || nx >= X || ny < 0 || ny >= Y || v[ny][nx]) break;
		}
		x = nx, y = ny;
	}

	return res;
}
```
