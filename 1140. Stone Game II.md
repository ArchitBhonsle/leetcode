# 1140. Stone Game II 

id:: 1140
name:: Stone Game II
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Recursion, Dynamic Programming

## Description
Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.  Initially, `M = 1`.

On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the **first** `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`.  Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** piles = `[2,7,9,4,4]`
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:**  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 

### Example 2
**Input:** piles = `[1,2,3,4,5,100]`
**Output:** 104

## Constraints
- $1 <= piles.length <= 100$
- $1 <= piles[i] <= 104$

## Algorithm
After a player makes their move, the rest of the game moves independently on the remaining piles. That is, all the moves made before, do not affect the decisions made my the players after. So for any turn, we make our move and solve the remaining game recursively. The base case being when we reach the end of the `piles`.

Since both the players will use the same optimal logic, we can use the same `solve` function. The function will return a pair with the other player's score and the caller's score for the rest of the piles.

In the solve function we
- Return `{ 0, 0 }` as we have used up all the piles.
- Now we iterate from the start of the remaining array, incrementing `2 * m` times.
- We use a variable `sum` to keep track of the points gained if we use the piles so far.
- Then we recursively call the function for the rest of the array, with the adjusted `m`.
- The score for our player would be the sum of the score for the remaining section and `sum`.
- We just keep track of the choice which gives us the best score and return it.

This `solve` function is called with the same arguments many times and can be optimised with a simple cache.

## Complexity
- Time: $?$
- Space: $O(n^2)$

## Code
```cpp
auto stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) -> int {
	map<pair<int, int>, pair<int, int>> cache;
	auto solve = [&](auto&& solve, int idx, int m) -> pair<int, int> {
		if (cache.count({ idx, m })) return cache[{ idx, m }];
		if (idx == piles.size()) return { 0, 0 };

		auto sum = 0;
		auto res = pair<int, int>(0, 0);
		for (auto i = idx; i < min((int) piles.size(), idx + 2 * m); ++i) {
			auto x = i - idx + 1;
			sum += piles[i];

			auto [ other, self ] = solve(solve, i + 1, max(m, x));
			if (res.first <= self + sum) res = { self + sum, other };
		}
		return cache[{ idx, m }] = res;
	};

	return solve(solve, 0, 1).first;
}
