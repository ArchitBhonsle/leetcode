# 443. String Compression 

id:: 443
name:: String Compression
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Strings, Two Pointers

## Description
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

-   If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
-   Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array,** return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

## Examples
**Input:** chars = `["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"`]
**Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: `["a","2","b","2","c","3"`]
**Explanation:** The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

**Input:** chars = `["a"`]
**Output:** Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: `["a"`]
**Explanation:** The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

**Input:** chars = `["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"`]
**Output:** Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: `["a","b","1","2"`].
**Explanation:** The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".

## Algorithm
1. Since we are operating on the same vector we are iterating on, we maintain a `write` iterator which always point to the next location we will be writing at.
2. Then, we use the [[notes/programming/algorithms/Two Pointers|two pointers]] method where `i` points to the current character and `j` scans for the next character.
3. If the distance between `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then we also write the count.
4. Note that the size of string-ified `count` can never be greater than the number of repeated characters it is compressing so `write` never goes ahead of `i`. 

## Code
```cpp
auto compress(vector<char>& chars) {
	auto write = chars.begin();
	for (auto i = chars.begin(); i != chars.end();) {
		*write++ = *i;

		auto j = i + 1;
		while (j != chars.end() && *j == *i) ++j;

		if (auto count = distance(i, j); count > 1)
			for (const auto& c : to_string(count))
				*write++ = c;

		i = j;
	}
	chars.resize(distance(chars.begin(), write));

	return chars.size();
}
```

To avoid the `to_string` allocation, we can do the following:
```cpp
if (auto count = distance(i, j); count > 1) {
	auto writeStart = write;
	while (count > 0) {
		auto digit = count % 10;
		count /= 10;

		*write++ = '0' + digit;
	}
	reverse(writeStart, write);
}
```
```
