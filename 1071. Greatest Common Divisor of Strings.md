# 1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings 

id:: 1071
name:: Greatest Common Divisor of Strings
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Strings

## Description
For two strings `s` and `t`, we say "`t` divides `s`" if and only if `s = t + ... + t` (i.e., `t` is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and  `str2`.

## Examples
**Input:** str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
**Output:** "ABC"

**Input:** str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
**Output:** "AB"

**Input:** str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
**Output:** ""

## Algorithm
The program itself is self explanatory. I have no idea how I would have come up with this.

## Code
```cpp
auto gcdOfStrings(string s1, string s2) -> string {
	return (s1 + s2 == s2 + s1)  
		? s1.substr(0, gcd(size(s1), size(s2)))
		: "";
}
```
