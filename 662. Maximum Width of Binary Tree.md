# 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree 

id:: 662
name:: Maximum Width of Binary Tree
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Trees, Binary Trees, Level-order Traversal

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the **maximum width** of the given tree_.

The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum **width** among all levels.

The **width** of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of a **32-bit** signed integer.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/width1-tree.jpg)
**Input:** root = `[1,3,2,5,3,null,9]`
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).

### Example 2
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/14/maximum-width-of-binary-tree-v3.jpg)
**Input:** root = `[1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]`
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).

### Example 3
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/width3-tree.jpg)
**Input:** root = `[1,3,2,5]`
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).

## Constraints
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range $[1, 3000]$.
-   $-100$ <= `Node.val` <= $100$

## Algorithm
This can be solved by a simple [[Level Order Traversal|level order traversal]] which is just a modified version of [[Breadth-First Search|Breadth-First Search]] where we consume the entire level at a time. Here,
1. We keep track the number or `idx` for every node.
2. The first `idx` of the level is the lowest and the last is the largest. The difference between the two is the width of that level.
3. Note that when queuing a node's children for the next level we "normalise" the `idx` to avoid integer overflows.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$ as every node is visited once.
- Space: $O(w)$ where $w$ is the maximum number of nodes at any level

## Code
```cpp
auto widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
	auto result = 0l;

	queue<pair<TreeNode*, long>> bfs, bfsTemp;
	bfs.push({ root, 0 });
	while (!bfs.empty()) {
		auto low = -1l, high = -1l;
		while (!bfs.empty()) {
			auto [ node, idx ] = bfs.front(); bfs.pop();
			if (low == -1l) low = idx;
			high = idx;

			if (node->left) bfsTemp.push({ node->left, 2 * (idx - low) });
			if (node->right) bfsTemp.push({ node->right, 2 * (idx - low) + 1 });
		}
		result = max(result, high - low + 1);

		swap(bfs, bfsTemp);
	}

	return result;
}
```
