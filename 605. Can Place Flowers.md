# 605. Can Place Flowers 

id:: 605
name:: Can Place Flowers
difficulty:: Easy
category:: Greedy Approach

## Description
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return _if_ `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** flowerbed = `[1,0,0,0,1]`, n = 1
**Output:** true

### Example 2
**Input:** flowerbed = `[1,0,0,0,1]`, n = 2
**Output:** false

## Constraints
-   `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
-   `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
-   There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
-   `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

## Algorithm
This problem can be solved using the [[notes/programming/algorithms/Greedy Approach|greedy approach]].
1. Maintain two variables 
	- `maxFlowers`, which will be the maximum number of flowers that can be placed on the flowerbed 
	- `previous`, which is whether the previous spot has a flower now, placed or already present.
2. We iterate over the array 
	- If this spot is occupied the we set `previous` to `true` and move on as we cannot place a flower there. Before doing that we also need to check whether `previous` was `true` to reduce the `maxFlowers` count as the last flower placement violates the adjacency criteria.
	- If `previous` is set to `true` then we cannot place a flower here and move on.
	- Otherwise, we can place a flower so we increment the `maxFlowers` count and set `previous` to `true`.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) -> bool {
	auto maxFlowers = 0;
	auto previous = false;

	for (const auto& occupied : flowerbed) {
		if (occupied) {
			if (previous) --maxFlowers;
			previous = true;
			continue;
		}

		if (previous) {
			previous = false;
			continue;
		}

		++maxFlowers;
		previous = true;
	}

	return n <= maxFlowers;
}
```
