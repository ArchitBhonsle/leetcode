# 1035. Uncrossed Lines 

id:: 1035
name:: Uncrossed Lines
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Dynamic Programming, Recursion

## Description
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. We write the integers of `nums1` and `nums2` (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` such that:

-   `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`, and
-   the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return _the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way_.

## Examples
### Example 1
![Illustration](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/26/142.png)
**Input:** nums1 = `[1,4,2]`, nums2 = `[1,2,4]` **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram. We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from `nums1[1] = 4` to `nums2[2] = 4` will intersect the line from `nums1[2]=2` to `nums2[1]=2`.

### Example 2
**Input:** nums1 = `[2,5,1,2,5]`, nums2 = `[10,5,2,1,5,2]`
**Output:** 3

## Example 3
**Input:** nums1 = `[1,3,7,1,7,5]`, nums2 = `[1,9,2,5,1]`
**Output:** 2

## Constraints
-   `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
-   `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 2000`

## Algorithm
The condition of the lines not intersecting makes it so that we can never connect to a number behind the newest line. We cannot just greedily match numbers because of this condition. As matching two numbers, might have a negative impact in the long run as it cuts off choices.

This neatly becomes a recursive problem defined by the current boundaries of both the arrays. We consider the first element in one of the arrays and consider two cases. One `without` find it in the other array and one `with` finding its pair. For the first case, we simply move the boundary of that array ahead. For the second, we find this element in the other array and choose the first match. Selecting matches further in the array only harms the solution. For this case the answer would be `1 +` the solution after moving both the boundaries ahead of both the consumed elements. For the solution to this recursive call, we simply take the maximum of both the cases.

Simple recursion is too slow as there are many repeated computations. We can fix that using a simple `cache`.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(nm)$
- Space: $O(nm)$

## Code
```cpp
auto maxUncrossedLines(vector<int>& n1, vector<int>& n2) -> int {
	auto cache = vector<vector<int>>(n1.size(), vector<int>(n2.size(), -1));
	
	auto solve = [&](auto&& solve, auto b1, auto b2) {
		if (b1 == n1.end() || b2 == n2.end()) return 0;

		auto d1 = distance(n1.begin(), b1), d2 = distance(n2.begin(), b2);
		if (cache[d1][d2] != -1) return cache[d1][d2];

		auto without = solve(solve, b1 + 1, b2);

		auto it = find(b2, n2.end(), *b1);
		auto with = it == n2.end()
			? 0
			: 1 + solve(solve, b1 + 1, it + 1);

		return cache[d1][d2] = max(with, without);
	};

	return solve(solve, n1.begin(), n2.begin());
}
```
