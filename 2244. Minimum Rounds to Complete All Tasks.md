# 2244. Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks

id:: 2244
name::  Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Implementation

## Description
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.

Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or `-1` if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.

## Examples
**Input:** tasks = `[2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]`
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.

**Input:** tasks = `[2,3,3]`
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.

## Algorithm
1. Group the tasks using a map.
2. If a given difficulty has only one task, it cannot be processed.
3. For all other cases, we can divide the tasks in groups of 3.
4. If a last round of 1 or 2 tasks is remaining, we can either process it by pulling a task from the previous round or on its own respectively.

## Code
```go
func minimumRounds(tasks []int) int {
    freqs := make(map[int]int)
    for _, v := range tasks {
        freqs[v] += 1
    }

    rounds := 0
    for _, v := range freqs {
        if v == 1 {
            return -1
        }

        rounds += v / 3
        if v % 3 != 0 {
            rounds += 1
        }
    }

    return rounds
}
```
