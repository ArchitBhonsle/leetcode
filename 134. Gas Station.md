# 134. Gas Station

id:: 134
name:: Gas Station
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Greedy

## Description
There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

## Examples
**Input:** gas = `[1,2,3,4,5]`, cost = `[3,4,5,1,2]`
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Input:** gas = `[2,3,4]`, cost = `[3,4,3]`
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

## Algorithm
1. First, we check the difference between the total gas and the cost. If the total gas is not enough, we return `-1`.
2. We exploit the fact that we know there is a solution and make a single pass checking if we have enough gas to reach a given index. 
3. During this iteration we maintain the gas in our tank. If this gas ever goes below 0, we can safely discard all the indices so far can reset our tank for the next index and start over again.
4. All of this hinges on the fact that if there is a total surplus of gas compared to the cost, the solution has to exist. This makes intuitive sense, but is not that simple to prove.

## Code
```cpp
int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
	int totalSurplus = transform_reduce(
		gas.begin(), gas.end(), cost.begin(), 0, plus<>(), minus<>());
	if (totalSurplus < 0) return -1;

	int n = gas.size(), tank = 0, start = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
		if (tank < 0) {
			tank = 0;
			start = i + 1;
		}
	}

	return start;
}
```
