# 1406. Stone Game III 

id:: 1406
name:: Stone Game III
difficulty:: Hard (Medium)
category:: Recursion, Dynamic Programming

## Description
Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones **arranged in a row**, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take `1`, `2`, or `3` stones from the **first** remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is `0` initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob **play optimally**.

Return `"Alice"` _if Alice will win,_ `"Bob"` _if Bob will win, or_ `"Tie"` _if they will end the game with the same score_.

## Examples
### **Example 1:**
**Input:** values = `[1,2,3,7]`
**Output:** "Bob"
**Explanation:** Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.

### Example 2
**Input:** values = `[1,2,3,-9]`
**Output:** "Alice"
**Explanation:** Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

### Example 3
**Input:** values = `[1,2,3,6]`
**Output:** "Tie"
**Explanation:** Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

## Constraints
- $1 <= stoneValue.length <= 5 * 10^4$
- $-1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000$

## Algorithm
This takes uses the same approach as [[leetcode/1140. Stone Game II|1140. Stone Game II]] but is actually easier.

Irrespective of the player, at a given point, the player can try out all the three options and recursively check the outcomes of their opponent. Using that information, the player can choose the best move. The base case for this recursion is when we have reached the end of the stones. 

The same section of the array is queried many times can this can be optimised and the results can be cached.

## Complexity
- Time: $?$
- Space: $O(n)$

## Code
```cpp
auto stoneGameIII(vector<int>& values) -> string {
	auto cache = vector<optional<pair<int, int>>>(values.size(), nullopt);
	auto solve = [&values, &cache](auto&& solve, int idx) -> pair<int, int> {
		if (idx == values.size()) return { 0, 0 };
		if (auto cached = cache[idx]; cached) return *cached;

		auto res = pair<int, int>(INT_MIN, INT_MIN);
		auto sum = 0;
		for (auto i = idx; i < min((int) values.size(), idx + 3); ++i) {
			sum += values[i];

			auto [ other, self ] = solve(solve, i + 1);
			if (res.first < self + sum)
				res = { self + sum, other };
		}

		cache[idx] = res;
		return res;
	};

	auto [ alice, bob ] = solve(solve, 0);

	return alice == bob ? "Tie" : alice > bob ? "Alice" : "Bob";
}
