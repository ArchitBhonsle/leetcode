# 71. Simplify Path 

id:: 71
name:: Simplify Path
difficulty:: Medium (Easy)
category:: Implementation, Stacks

## Description
Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

-   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
-   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
-   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
-   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** path = "/home/"
**Output:** "/home"
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

### Example 2
**Input:** path = "/../"
**Output:** "/"
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

### Example 3
**Input:** path = "/home//foo/"
**Output:** "/home/foo"
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

## Constraints
-   $1$ <= `path.length` <= $3000$
-   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
-   `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

## Algorithm
This is a simple implementation problem.
1. Add a `/` to the end to make parsing easy.
2. Maintain iterators to two `/`s demarcating the current directory to be parsed.
3. Use a stack to maintain the current hierarchy of directories.
4. Parse till the end of the `path`.
	1. Ignore `"."`.
	2. Pop a directory for `".."`. Check for an empty stack.
	3. Otherwise push the directory name onto the stack.
5. After parsing, reverse the stack to get the correct order.
6. And empty the stack while concatenating into a `result` string.
7. If the string is empty, return `/`.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(n)$

## Code
```cpp
auto simplifyPath(string path) {
	if (path.back() != '/') path.push_back('/');
	
	auto prv = path.begin(),
		nxt = find(next(prv), path.end(), '/');

	stack<string> dirs;
	while (nxt != path.end()) {
		if (nxt != next(prv)) {
			string dir(next(prv), nxt);

			if (dir == ".") {
			} else if (dir == "..") {
				if (dirs.size()) dirs.pop();
			} else {
				dirs.push(dir);
			}
		}
		prv = nxt;
		nxt = find(next(prv), path.end(), '/');
	}

	stack<string> rev;
	while (dirs.size()) {
		rev.push(dirs.top());
		dirs.pop();
	}
	swap(dirs, rev);

	string result;
	while (dirs.size()) {
		result += "/" + dirs.top();
		dirs.pop();
	}
	return result.size() ? result : "/";
}
