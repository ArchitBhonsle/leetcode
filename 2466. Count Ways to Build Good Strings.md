# 2466. Count Ways to Build Good Strings 

id:: 2466
name:: Count Ways to Build Good Strings
difficulty:: Medium (Medium-Hard)
category:: Dynamic Programming

## Description
Given the integers `zero`, `one`, `low`, and `high`, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

-   Append the character `'0'` `zero` times.
-   Append the character `'1'` `one` times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A **good** string is a string constructed by the above process having a **length** between `low` and `high` (**inclusive**).

Return _the number of **different** good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties._ Since the answer can be large, return it **modulo** $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** 
One possible valid good string is "011". 
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.

### Example 2
**Input:** low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".

## Constraints
-   $1 <= \texttt{low} <= \texttt{high} <= 10^5$
-   $1 <= \texttt{zero}, \texttt{one} <= \texttt{low}$

## Algorithm
This problem can be solved using [[notes/Dynamic Programming]]. Our `dp` array contains the number of ways to reach a given length for all lengths from `0` to `high`. We start with a `0` length array and can only increase the sizes by `one` or `zero`. With these constraints we will the array while keeping the mod rules in mind. At the end we simply add the numbers in the specified range.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(\texttt{high})$
- Space: $O(\texttt{high})$

## Code
```cpp
auto countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) -> int {
	auto mod = (int) (1e9 + 7);

	auto dp = vector<int>(high + 1, 0);
	dp[0] = 1;
	for (auto i = 0u; i <= high; ++i) {
		if (i + zero <= high) dp[i + zero] = (dp[i + zero] + dp[i]) % mod;
		if (i + one <= high) dp[i + one] = (dp[i + one] + dp[i]) % mod;
	}

	auto res = 0;
	for (auto i = low; i <= high; ++i) res = (res + dp[i]) % mod;
	return res;
}
```
