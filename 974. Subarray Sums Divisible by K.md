# 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K 

id:: 974
name:: Subarray Sums Divisible by K
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Arrays, Remainders

## Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty sub-arrays that have a sum divisible by `k`.

A sub-array is a contiguous part of an array.

## Examples
**Input:** nums = `[4,5,0,-2,-3,1]`, k = 5
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
`[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]`

**Input:** nums = `[5]`, k = 9
**Output:** 0

## Algorithm
1.  The sum of a sub-array between two prefix arrays is divisible by `k` if both these sub-arrays have the same remainders when divided by `k`. (This is simple to prove and intuitive too).
2. So we iterate over the array while remembering the frequency of every possible remainder. 
3. We increment the count by the number of previous occurrences of a remainder as it increases the number of sub-arrays by that amount.
4. The frequency of 0 is initialised to 1 as it cleanly manages the corner case where the prefix array's sum itself is divisible by `k`.

## Code
```cpp
auto subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
	vector<int> remainderFreqs(k);
	remainderFreqs[0] = 1;

	auto count = 0, sum = 0;
	for (auto& n: nums) {
		sum += n;

		auto remainder = sum % k;
		while (remainder < 0) remainder += k;

		count += remainderFreqs[remainder];
		++remainderFreqs[remainder];
	}

	return count;
}
```
