# 72. Edit Distance 

id:: 72
name:: Edit Distance
difficulty:: Hard (Medium)
category:: Dynamic Programming

## Description
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`_.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
-   Insert a character
-   Delete a character
-   Replace a character

## Examples
**Input:** word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
```
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Input:** word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 
```
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Algorithm
This is a classic [[notes/Dynamic Programming|dynamic programming]] problem. We will use a 2-dimensional array where `dp[i][j]` is the number of operations to convert `word1[0..i]` to `word2[0..j]`.

The base case is `dp[0][0]` which is `0` for obvious reasons but `dp[i][0]` will be `i` because we will need to delete all the characters from `word1` to get to an empty string. Similarly `dp[0][j]` will be `j`.

Now as for the recursive relation, if `word1[i] == word2[j]` then `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` will simply be `dp[i][j]` as no changes are needed. If they are not equal then we can get from all the previous states with a single operation. So we take a minimum of all the previous values and add 1.

## Code
```cpp
auto minDistance(string a, string b) -> int {
	auto la = a.size(), lb = b.size();

	vector<vector<int>> dp(la + 1, vector<int>(lb + 1, 0));
	for (auto i = 0; i <= la; ++i) dp[i][0] = i;
	for (auto j = 0; j <= lb; ++j) dp[0][j] = j;

	for (auto i = 0; i < la; ++i) {
		for (auto j = 0; j < lb; ++j) {
			dp[i + 1][j + 1] = 
				(a[i] == b[j]) ? 
				dp[i][j] : 
				(
					min({
						dp[i][j],
						dp[i][j + 1],
						dp[i + 1][j]
					}) + 1
				);
		}
	}

	return dp[la][lb];
}
```
