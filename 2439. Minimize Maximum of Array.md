# 2439. Minimize Maximum of Array 

id:: 2439
name:: Minimize Maximum of Array
difficulty:: Medium
category:: Implementation

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` comprising of `n` non-negative integers.

In one operation, you must:
-   Choose an integer `i` such that `1 <= i < n` and `nums[i] > 0`.
-   Decrease `nums[i]` by 1.
-   Increase `nums[i - 1]` by 1.

Return _the **minimum** possible value of the **maximum** integer of_ `nums` _after performing **any** number of operations_.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** nums = `[3,7,1,6]`
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:**
One set of optimal operations is as follows:
1. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes `[4,6,1,6]`.
2. Choose i = 3, and nums becomes `[4,6,2,5]`.
3. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes `[5,5,2,5]`.
The maximum integer of nums is 5. It can be shown that the maximum number cannot be less than 5.
Therefore, we return 5.

### Example 2
**Input:** nums = `[10,1]`
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:**
It is optimal to leave nums as is, and since 10 is the maximum value, we return 10.

## Constraints
-   `n == nums.length`
-   $2$ <= `n` <= $10^5$
-   $0$ <= `nums[i]` <= $10^9$

## Algorithm
I copied this because I was bored for the day. It kind of makes sense once you realise that the one fundamental restriction of the operation we can perform is that since we can decrease a value at a given index only at the cost of increasing the value behind it.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(1)$

## Code
```cpp
auto minimizeArrayValue(vector<int>& nums) {
	long long ans = 0, sum = 0;
	for (auto i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
		sum += nums[i];
		ans = max(ans, (sum + i) / (i + 1));
	}
	return ans;
}
```
