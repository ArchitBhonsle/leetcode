# 2405. Optimal Partition of String 

id:: 2405
name:: Optimal Partition of String
difficulty:: Medium 
category:: Implementation

## Description
Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such that the characters in each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than **once**.

Return _the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition._

Note that each character should belong to exactly one sub-string in a partition.

## Examples
### Example 1
**Input:** s = "abacaba"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.

### Example 2
**Input:** s = "ssssss"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:**
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").

## Constraints
-   $1$ <= `s.length` <= $10^5$
-   `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.

## Algorithm
The algorithm is quite straight-forward.

## Complexity
- Time: $O(n)$
- Space: $O(26)$

## Code
```cpp
auto partitionString(string s) {
	auto parts = 1;
	array<bool, 26> present; present.fill(false);
	for (const auto c : s) {
		if (present[c - 'a']) {
			present.fill(false);
			++parts;
		}
		present[c - 'a'] = true;
	}
	return parts;
}
```
